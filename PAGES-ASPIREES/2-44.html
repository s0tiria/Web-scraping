<p>With the abundance of <a href="http://time.com/4537960/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nasty-woman-debate/">sound bites</a> to come out of Wednesday&#8217;s <a href="http://time.com/4538386/jimmy-kimmel-kids-final-presidential-debate/">presidential debate</a>, it seems only fitting that <a href="http://time.com/3737214/weird-al-yankovic-comedy-central-night-of-too-many-stars-autism-benefit/">Weird Al Yankovic</a> &mdash; parody songwriter extraordinaire &mdash; would step in to create an auto-tuned spoof of the night&#8217;s discussion.</p>
<p>In his new video for &#8220;Bad Hombres, Nasty Women,&#8221; the 56-year-old singer replaces Chris Wallace as the moderator of the final showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, interspersing his own mocking commentary with the two candidates&#8217; remarks. Notable lyrics include, &#8220;Can everyone achieve the American dream or should they sign up for my Ponzi scheme?,&#8221; and, &#8220;To stop a cold war what should we be doing &mdash; would you go thumb wrestle Vladimir Putin?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;That, as the first woman who had an opportunity to win the presidency, I think it was a real burden on her.&#8221; He said she saw her campaign as a way to open up &#8220;a whole range of new

middle class people who feel left out of the economy, and suggested that Trump&#8217;s victory can&#8217;t be explained by racism and sexism alone.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re all the people I grew

ended up just as messy and unexpected as the eighteen months that led up to it.<\/p>\n<p>As electors met around the country for the usually ceremonial <a

protesters gathered outside and a last-ditch movement tried to sway them to become &#8220;faithless&#8221; and back someone other than the winner of their state to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.<\/p>\n<p>But the effort ended up barely denting Trump&#8217;s lead, with more faithless electors abandoning Hillary Clinton, or trying to.<\/p>\n<p>In Texas, two electors defected from Trump. Chris Suprun, who had announced earlier in the month that he would not back Trump in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/12\/05\/opinion\/why-i-will-not-cast-my-electoral-vote-for-donald-trump.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">a guest editorial in the New York <em>Times<\/em><\/a>, ended up voting for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary. Another Texas elector <a href=\"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2016\/11\/art-sisneros-texas-electoral-college-resigns-231874\" target=\"_blank\">resigned rather than vote for Trump<\/a>, while a third voted for former U.S. Rep.

In Hawaii, an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kansascity.com\/news\/politics-government\/national-politics\/article121848883.html\" target=\"_blank\">elector cast a vote<\/a> for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/news\/politics\/2016\/12\/19\/maine-elector-says-vote-for-sanders-maine-elector-says-vote-for-sanders\/rzVD3ijtgKObvn5dbvzddN\/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">In Maine<\/a>, a Democratic elector attempted to cast his vote for Sanders, who won the state&#8217;s presidential caucus due to enthusiastic youth support, but that vote was ruled improper. He then switched his vote back to Clinton. A <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Marshall_Cohen\/status\/810920092896788480\" target=\"_blank\">Minnesota elector<\/a> attempted to vote for nobody, but was replaced by an elector who cast a vote for Clinton, that state&#8217;s winner.<\/p>\n<p>The votes for Colin Powell may have been part of an unlikely plan for Democratic electors to help to elect a Republican other than Trump, as championed by the so-called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/seattle-news\/politics\/how-these-washington-state-electors-plan-to-deny-trump-the-presidency\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton Electors.<\/a> That group encouraged Democrats to vote for a non-Trump Republican in the hope that anti-Trump Republicans might join in and deny Trump the 270 votes he needs to win. But despite nationwide protests and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/politics\/2016\/12\/republican-electors-are-getting-bombarded-requests-block-trump-presidency\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of phone calls and messages<\/a>, the plan gained little traction with Trump electors.<\/p>\n<p>In Washington, some electors even broke from the norm on vice presidential picks. Eight voted for Clinton&#8217;s running mate Tim Kaine, one voted for Elizabeth Warren, one voted for Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one voted for Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, and one voted for environmentalist Winona LaDuke.<\/p>\n<p>If Trump wins all the votes he is expected to win, he will have the 44th largest share out of 54 presidential elections since the current system began. Clinton, meanwhile, has maintained a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/la-na-pol-election-final-20161209-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">popular vote lead<\/a> of more than 2.8 million votes.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Kevin Castel ruled Monday that the public had a right to see the warrant, which he said was secretly filed with the court on Oct. 30.<\/p>\n<p>Agents used the warrant to get access to emails stored on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.<\/p>\n<p>FBI Director James Comey upended the presidential race on Oct. 28 when he informed Congress that agents would be digging through the cache of emails between Abedin and Clinton for any new evidence related to Clinton&#8217;s handling of sensitive State Department information.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Two days before the Nov. 8 election, Comey announced that the inquiry had uncovered no new evidence of wrongdoing. Historians will long debate whether the revelations factored into Clinton&#8217;s loss to Donald Trump.<\/p>\n<p>The court documents will be unsealed at noon Tuesday, with portions blacked out to conceal the names of the agents. The judge also ordered the redaction of any information about an open investigation of Weiner&#8217;s online correspondence with a teenage girl.<\/p>\n<p>Agents initially seized the computer in connection with that investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Weiner, a Democrat, resigned his seat in Congress after sexually explicit texts and social media posts to various women. He tried for a political comeback two years later by running for mayor of New York, but his campaign was undone when evidence emerged that he hadn&#8217;t given up his sexting habit.<\/p>\n<p>Federal authorities began investigating him in late September after an online news outlet, the Daily Mail, published an interview with a North Carolina girl who said she had exchanged sexually explicit messages with him over several months.<\/p>\n<p>Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles lawyer who specializes in recovering works of art stolen by the Nazis, petitioned the court to make the search warrant and supporting documents public.<\/p>\n<p>In his order, Castel said public interest in the case overrode any privacy considerations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Ordinarily, a person whose conduct is the subject of a criminal investigation but is not charged with a crime should not have his or her reputation sullied by the mere circumstance of an investigation,&#8221; he wrote. But in this instance, he said, the fact that the FBI investigated Clinton is hardly secret. &#8220;She has little remaining privacy interest in the release of the documents identifying her as the subject of this investigation.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

An Associated Press survey of electors found very little appetite to vote for alternative candidates.<\/p>\n<p>Republican electors say they have been deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support Trump. Many of the emails are part of coordinated campaigns.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The letters are actually quite sad,&#8221; said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. &#8220;They are generally freaked out. They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, &#8220;I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results of the Electoral College vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding as president of the Senate. Once the result is certified, the winner &mdash; likely Trump &mdash; will be sworn in on Jan. 20.<\/p>\n<p>The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input.<\/p>\n<p>The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress.<\/p>\n<p>To be elected president, the winner must get at least half plus one &mdash; or 270 electoral votes. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins that state&#8217;s popular vote. Maine and Nebraska award them by congressional district.<\/p>\n<p>The AP tried to reach all of the electors and interviewed more than 330 of them, finding widespread aggravation among Democrats with the electoral process, but little expectation Trump would be derailed.<\/p>\n<p>Some Democrats have argued that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it gives more weight to less populated states. That is how Hillary Clinton, who got more than 2.6 million more votes nationwide, lost the election to Trump. Some have also tried to dissuade Trump voters by arguing that he is unsuited to the job. Others cite the CIA&#8217;s assessment that Russia engaged in computer hacking to sway the election in favor of the Republican.<\/p>\n<p>But despite the national group therapy session being conducted by some Democrats, only one Republican elector told the AP that he will not vote for Trump.<\/p>\n<p>There is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote for the candidate who won their state. Some states require their electors to vote for the winning candidate, either by law or through signed pledges. But no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged, according to the National Archives.<\/p>\n<p>Those laws are rarely tested. More than 99 percent of electors through U.S. history have voted for the candidate who won their state.<\/p>\n<p>Electors are selected by state parties, and so are often insiders who can be trusted to vote for the party&#8217;s candidate. Many Republican electors said they feel duty-bound to honor their pledge to vote for the candidate who won their state, regardless of how they feel about Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Still, some anti-Trump activists have been getting creative in trying to persuade electors to dump Trump.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to thousands of emails, Republican elector Charlie Buckels of Louisiana said he received a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/fedex-58\/\" target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\">FedEx<\/a> package with a 50-page document that the sender said &#8220;had absolute proof that the Russians hacked the elections.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;From the tenor of these emails, you would think these people are curled up in a corner in a fetal position with a thumb in their mouth,&#8221; Buckels said.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Associated Press writers Hope Yen in Washington, Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, and Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

officials that Moscow hacked Democratic emails in a bid to elevate Trump. Even if it&#8217;s true, they said, Trump still won the White House fair and square.<\/p>\n<p>The pushback came a day before members of the Electoral College are scheduled to formally cast votes for Trump as the 45th president. While Democrats likely are powerless to stop it, they suggested Trump&#8217;s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton would forever be tainted by Russian meddling.<\/p>\n<p>Republican electors have been inundated by Trump opponents urging them to defy the results in their states and vote against Trump.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This whole thing is a spin job,&#8221; said Trump&#8217;s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus. &#8220;And I think what the Democrats ought to do is look in the mirror and face the reality that they lost the election.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Trump himself weighed in Sunday evening, tweeting, &#8220;If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned &amp; called terrible names!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The partisan swipes mostly ignored warnings by foreign policy experts that part of Russia&#8217;s calculation also was likely payback for years of U.S. criticism of its own elections and a desire to portray America as a flawed champion of democracy &mdash; potentially weakening U.S. power on the world stage. Russia has vehemently denied the accusation.<\/p>\n<p>Many lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, say voters may not have been swayed by the release of tens of thousands of private emails. But the fact that a foreign power tried to intervene in U.S. democracy and exploit divisions in American politics is cause for alarm, they say.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Trump&#8217;s transition team and loyalists on Capitol Hill weren&#8217;t buying it, at least not on the eve of the Electoral College vote.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the evidence?&#8221; asked Kellyanne Conway, another close Trump adviser.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about President Barack Obama&#8217;s vow to retaliate against the Russians, Conway said: &#8220;It seems like the president is under pressure from Team Hillary, who can&#8217;t accept the election results.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Democrats say it&#8217;s unlikely the public will ever hear detailed evidence because doing so would disclose classified sources and methods. But with last week&#8217;s declaration by CIA Director John Brennan that there was &#8220;strong consensus&#8221; that Russia hacked Democrats to try to sway the election, lawmakers are stepping up demands for closed-door briefings and a separate congressional investigation.<\/p>\n<p>California Rep. Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said an unclassified intelligence review could be released within the next two weeks or three weeks.<\/p>\n<p>As president-elect, Trump would have access to high-level intelligence on the matter, although it&#8217;s unclear what he&#8217;s been told. Trump has previously called the intelligence finding of Russian involvement &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; On Sunday, Conway said she wasn&#8217;t privy to the same intelligence briefings as the president-elect and couldn&#8217;t say what he knows.<\/p>\n<p>Donna Brazile, interim head of the Democratic National Committee, said the DNC was no match for a sophisticated foreign power in cyberspace that &#8220;weaponized&#8221; private emails to &#8220;sow misinformation and to sow discord&#8221; between Clinton and her primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.<\/p>\n<p>Also on Sunday:<\/p>\n<p>&mdash;Brazile said the cyberattacks against the DNC occurred every day through the end of the election. The comment seemed to contradict Obama&#8217;s assertion that they stopped after he warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in September.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash;Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz., called for creation of a special Senate investigative committee focused on Russia, China and Iran potentially trying to interfere in U.S. elections through high-tech meddling.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash;Priebus said he was &#8220;100 percent confident&#8221; that the Senate would confirm <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/exxon-mobil-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil<\/a> CEO Rex Tillerson as Trump&#8217;s secretary of state. The oil company oil executive has deep ties to Russia and no government experience.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash;Priebus said the naming of lawyer David Friedman as Trump&#8217;s ambassador to Israel doesn&#8217;t mean that Trump rejects the notion of a two-state solution in the Middle East. Friedman has suggested Trump would support Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank, effectively eliminating the possibility of a Palestinian state.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be things that individually people may believe in their hearts or in their mind,&#8221; Priebus said of Trump&#8217;s nominees to top posts. &#8220;But ultimately, it&#8217;s their job to represent the president-elect of the United States and his foreign policy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Priebus appeared on &#8220;Fox News Sunday,&#8221; Conway was interviewed on CBS&#8217; &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; and Brazile and Schiff were on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Administration officials on Thursday also assailed Trump himself, saying he must have known of Russia&#8217;s interference.<\/p>\n<p>No proof was offered for any of the accusations, the latest to unsettle America&#8217;s uneasy transition from eight years under Obama to a new Republican administration led by Trump. The claims of Russian meddling in the election also have heightened already debilitating tensions between Washington and Moscow over Syria, Ukraine and a host of other disagreements.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Only Russia&#8217;s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,&#8221; presidential spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters assembled in the White House briefing room, repeating the words from an October U.S. intelligence assessment.<\/p>\n<p>Obama&#8217;s deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, connected the dots further, saying it was Putin who was responsible for the Russian government&#8217;s actions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,&#8221; he told MSNBC.<\/p>\n<p>The explosive accusation paints Putin, the leader of perhaps America&#8217;s greatest geopolitical foe, as having directly undermined U.S. democracy. U.S. officials have not contended, however, that Trump would have been defeated by Clinton on Nov. 8 if not for Russia&#8217;s assistance. Nor has there has been any indication of tampering with the vote-counting.<\/p>\n<p>The Kremlin rejected the claim of Putin&#8217;s involvement, with Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissing it as &#8220;laughable nonsense.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There has been no specific, persuasive evidence shared publicly about the extent of Putin&#8217;s role or knowledge of the hackings. That lack of proof undercuts Democrats&#8217; strategy to portray Putin&#8217;s involvement as irrefutable evidence of a directed Russian government plot to undermine America&#8217;s democratic system.<\/p>\n<p>The dispute over Russia&#8217;s role is fueling an increasingly public spat between Obama&#8217;s White House and Trump&#8217;s team that is threatening to spoil the delicate truce that Obama and Trump have forged since Election Day to smooth the billionaire businessman&#8217;s move to the White House in little over a month.<\/p>\n<p>Although the president and president-elect have mostly avoided criticizing each other publicly since Trump&#8217;s win, their aides have been more openly antagonistic. Obama, however, did take a direct swipe at Trump in an interview on Comedy Central&#8217;s &#8220;The Daily Show&#8221; earlier this week, noting that Trump at one point in the campaign had publicly encouraged Moscow to find and release information on Clinton.<\/p>\n<p>Kellyanne Conway, Trump&#8217;s senior transition adviser, said it was &#8220;breathtaking&#8221; and irresponsible that the White House had suggested Trump knew Russia was interfering to help his campaign.<\/p>\n<p>That led Earnest to unload from the White House, arguing that Trump, who has dismissed the CIA&#8217;s assessment of Russian interference, should spend less time attacking the intelligence community and more time supporting the investigation that Obama has ordered.<\/p>\n<p>Earnest said it was &#8220;obvious&#8221; Trump knew what Russia was doing during the campaign, pointing out that Trump had encouraged Moscow during a news conference to find Clinton&#8217;s missing emails, repeating the assertion Obama made in &#8220;The Daily Show&#8221; appearance.<\/p>\n<p>Trump has said he was joking.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody at the White House thinks it&#8217;s funny that an adversary of the United States engaged in malicious cyber activity to destabilize our democracy,&#8221; Earnest said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a joke.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>U.S. intelligence officials have linked the hacking to Russia&#8217;s intelligence agency and its military intelligence division. Moscow has denied all accusations that it orchestrated the hacking of email accounts of Democratic Party officials and Clinton&#8217;s campaign chief, John Podesta, and then leaked them to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.<\/p>\n<p>Trump and his supporters insist the Democrats&#8217; outrage about Russia is really an attempt to undermine the validity of his election victory.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Democrats pounced on the latest suggestions of Putin being connected to the daily drip of emails during the presidential race from some of Clinton&#8217;s closest advisers.<\/p>\n<p>Putin was &#8220;clearly involved,&#8221; said outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Having been the former head of the KGB, does that surprise you?&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;And does it surprise anybody today when he denied it?&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Donald Trump calls it a &#8220;scam.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Stein&#8217;s effort does raise a few red flags. She jacked up her fundraising goals (from $2.5 million to the current $9 million) as cash poured in, changed her estimates of attorneys&#8217; fees and has furnished no concrete evidence of voting shenanigans. She&#8217;s raising money for recounts that may not happen, in a race where she played spoiler, and she&#8217;s been vague about what will happen to any money left over from the fundraising drive.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Yet campaign finance lawyers say there&#8217;s no indication that Trump&#8217;s charge is true. Stein may be draining grassroots resources, but she has so far spent the money the way she promised. The real danger for Democrats is that her doomed project is a sign of a problem that has longed plagued Republicans.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the Obama Administration, the GOP has struggled with the scourge of the &#8220;scam PAC.&#8221; These groups raise money by pledging to accomplish a certain goal&mdash;draft a candidate to run for office, or drive a policy goal&mdash;then use the cash to enrich themselves. The Federal Election Commission recently recommended that Congress crack down on fraudulent outfits, defining them as groups which &#8220;solicit contributions with promises of supporting candidates, but then disclose minimal or no candidate support activities while engaging in significant and continuous fundraising, which predominantly funds personal compensation for the committees&#8217; organizers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Movement conservatives have long bemoaned <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/23001\/conservatives-inc\/\">the proliferation of scam PACs<\/a> in their ranks. One reason for the phenomenon is the simplicity of the formula: pinpoint a source of grassroots outrage or excitement, rent a mailing list, pump out solicitations and reinvest the cash on ever-more fundraising appeals&mdash;all while pocketing a share of the proceeds. There are different theories why conservatives have been ripe for plunder: an aging, web-baffled base; a media bubble; the lack of a consensus leader; the ideological gulf between the party&#8217;s grassroots and its elected officials. But the primary reason is the party has been out of the White House and unable to achieve many of its signature promises. Scam PACs thrive on outrage.<\/p>\n<p>But now the script is flipped. The Democratic base is furious about the results of the election, rippling with anger toward Trump and facing a leadership vacuum. Some nefarious entrepreneurs will try to wring profit from this sense of powerlessness. &#8220;I am sure we&#8217;ll see more groups popping up, more unscrupulous political operatives tapping into public dissatisfaction with Trump and public anger over his election,&#8221; says Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Jossey, a Virginia campaign-finance lawyer, has an idea about how they&#8217;ll do it. &#8220;If I wanted to make a million dollars tomorrow,&#8221; he says, &#8220;all I&#8217;d have to do is start a PAC, name it something like the &#8216;PAC Against Citizens United,&#8217; buy some email lists, and in a month I&#8217;d have a million dollars or maybe more.&#8221; Jossey speaks from authority: he worked for a firm whose mission was to separate gullible Tea Partyers from their money, and he opened the playbook earlier this year in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/magazine\/story\/2016\/08\/tea-party-pacs-ideas-death-214164\" target=\"_blank\">a piece<\/a> for <em>Politico<\/em>. The structural conditions that give rise to scam PACs haven&#8217;t been present on the left, Jossey says, because the average small-dollar liberal donor has been reasonably happy with President Obama and ideologically in sync with congressional leaders like Nancy Pelosi.<\/p>\n<p>But Democrats haven&#8217;t been entirely immune to the phenomenon. One political fundraiser who created a host of pro-Bernie Sanders websites was later <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/bernie-sanders-super-pac_us_57743947e4b042fba1cf0f87\" target=\"_blank\">charged with fraud<\/a>. Jossey singles out another group called Progressives United PAC, founded by former Wisconsin Senator candidate Russ Feingold&mdash;the longtime campaign-finance reform advocate&mdash;as an example of a PAC that raised millions, spent little of it on the party&#8217;s political candidates, and funneled most of it toward staff salaries and more fundraising appeals. (The group has repeatedly defended its work and dismissed the charge, which surfaced during Feingold&#8217;s failed campaign to win back his Senate seat last month.) But &#8220;while there have been a few [scam PACs] here and there,&#8221; says Fischer, &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t seem to have been as endemic a problem on the left.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to imagine that changing. Obama is on his way out. Fury toward Trump is unlikely to abate. And the Democrats&#8217; top negotiator on Capitol Hill will be incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a moderate deal-maker whose Wall Street ties are anathema to the ascendant liberal wing of the base.<\/p>\n<p>In the age of Trump, the looming danger for Democrats may not be outright grift but rather that an avalanche of futile solicitations will siphon cash from worthier causes. Political fundraising is more or less a zero-sum game. Every buck a small donor sends toward Stein&#8217;s recount is a dollar that probably doesn&#8217;t go toward organizing at the local level or rebuilding shattered state parties.<\/p>\n<p>And some of the biggest grassroots outfits on the progressive left specialize in peddling false hope. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which declined an interview request for this story, is currently asking its nearly 1 million members for $3 apiece to support efforts to reform the Electoral College and organize protests designed to convince electors to vote for Clinton instead.<\/p>\n<p>Even when such groups aren&#8217;t asking for money, they may be preparing to profit off subscribers&#8217; activism. MoveOn.org has garnered more than 400,000 signatures on a petition asking Congress to block Trump aide Steve Bannon&#8217;s appointment as a senior White House adviser.
