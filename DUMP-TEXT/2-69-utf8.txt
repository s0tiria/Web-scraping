MEDIA DECODER; Yankovic Sues Sony Over Online Royalties

By BEN SISARIO

Published: April 3, 2012

   Adding to the recent wave of artists suing record companies over online
   royalties, ''Weird Al'' Yankovic has sued Sony Music Entertainment,
   saying he is owed more than $5 million. In the suit, filed Friday at
   United States District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Yankovic says the
   company underpaid him for videos and other expenses, and also
   incorrectly counted downloads of his music as ''sales'' rather than as
   ''licenses,'' which pay a higher royalty rate.

   He also asks for money from industry settlements with Napster, Kazaa,
   Grokster and other file-sharing services, and says he is owed $2.5
   million from Sony's share of the sale of YouTube in 2006. Sony,
   Universal and the Warner Music Group had owned a stake in YouTube, and
   when that company was sold to Google for $1.65 billion, the labels made
   a reported $50 million.

   Sony, which declined to comment on Mr. Yankovic's case, last month
   offered an $8 million settlement with musicians in a class-action
   lawsuit over digital royalties.

   Songwriter Royalties Are Up in Britain: Thanks to a growth in digital
   music sales and the popularity of British artists overseas, songwriters
   and publishers there enjoyed a slight gain in royalties last year. PRS
   for Music, a collecting agency, had just over $1 billion in revenue, up
   3.2 percent from 2010, the group announced. (After expenses, the agency
   distributed $893 million to its members.) Publishing royalties from
   record sales fell 13.3 percent, but money from online sales jumped 45.3
   percent, to $62 million, and PRS's international collections grew 10.6
   percent, to $301 million.

   In one sign of the times, songwriters in Britain now earn more from
   digital music than from the performance of their music in pubs.

   An App Festival Returns: The iHeartRadio Music Festival, a two-day
   event in Las Vegas to promote Clear Channel Communications' radio app,
   will return for a second year on Sept. 21 and 22 at the MGM Grand, the
   company announced. Last year's inaugural festival featured Lady Gaga,
   Coldplay, Black Eyed Peas and Kelly Clarkson, among others.

   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared
   in print.
