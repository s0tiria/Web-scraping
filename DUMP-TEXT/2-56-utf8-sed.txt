Lily Bevan often says 'quite weird things' to strangers

   22 September 2016 Last updated at 13:15 BST

   Comedian Lily Bevan has co-written a play called Talking to Strangers,
   which is a series of monologues in which characters talk to strangers.

   She told the BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight that she talks to people
   she does not know and it "can be really endearing".
