   [AuthaMap4.jpg] Authagraph

   Creating a proportional map of the world is tricky because the world is
   a sphere and a map is flat. That creates visual distortions, which
   explains why Mercator projections shrink Africa and super-size
   Greenland. Designer Hajime Narukawa found a clever solution to this
   problem: triangles.

   Narukawa’s AuthaGraph World Map, which recently won the grand prize
   in Japan’s biggest design competition, retains the proportions of the
   continents and oceans—so much so that you can fold it into a
   three-dimensional globe. Like magic! He achieved this by dividing the
   globe into 96 triangles and projecting them onto a tetrahedron,
   preserving the proportions of water and land. Then he unfolded the
   tetrahedron into a rectangle, where the 96 sections created a map
   resembling the surface of the original globe, only flat.

   The general shapes of the continents are consistent with more familiar
   maps, but their orientation is not. On the AuthaGraph Map, continents
   curve upward like a smile. Africa and the Americas look like they
   swapped places. And longitude and latitude are no longer a tidy grid.
   But  all maps require tradeoffs. You want an equal area map? Prepare
   for distortion. You want a Mercator? You’re living a lie. The
   AuthaGraph isn’t perfect—the creators concede that it needs “a further
   step to increase a number of subdivision for improving its accuracy to
   be officially called an area-equal map” the project creators write on
   their website—but it’s pretty damn close.
