Weird and wonderful jobs in 360°: the high-flying life of a wingwalker

   Whether she is performing aerobatic routines over the Palm Islands in
   Dubai or taking part in summer shows with her sister across Europe,
   every day is an exciting one for wingwalker Emily Guilding.

   In the video below, Guilding takes you on a 360 tour of the skies above
   Gloucester, travelling at speeds of up to 160 miles an hour atop a
   vintage biplane.

   “The most difficult part is the fact that it's extremely physically
   demanding," reveals Guilding. "From the ground, it looks quite elegant
   when you’re watching it and sort of graceful, but if you ever have a go
   yourself you will realise that actually the wind pressure, the
   turbulence, it all creates a very difficult environment.”

   Guilding, who works full-time for the Breitling Wingwalkers alongside
   her sister Stella, traded her traditional 9-to-5 in favour of the
   high-flying role several years ago.

   “I had a very conventional career in a office based job and I just
   thought one day there has got to be more to life than sitting in an
   office," says the 31-year-old. "I heard they were recruiting for a new
   wingwalker, I decided to apply and three years later here I am.”

   Asked what she loves about her role, Guilding replies: "travelling up
   to 160mph, the feeling that that gives you is just absolutely
   incredible."

   "It is the best job in the world."

   Future episodes in this series will give you a behind-the-scenes
   glimpse at some of the nation’s most fun and unusual jobs, including a
   stunt driver and a librarian at the world-famous Bodleian Libraries in
   Oxford. In last week’s episode, the star of Charlie and the Chocolate
   Factory took viewers on a 360 tour of the popular West End show.
