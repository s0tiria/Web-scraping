   The idea of paying to have money in the bank seems unfair, and frankly
   just plain weird. It is indeed a strange idea for strange economic
   times. Let me take a moment to explain why anyone would want to do
   this.

   Banks have bank accounts of their own with the central bank. In the
   UK's case - that is the Bank of England. For countries that use the
   euro it's the European Central Bank (ECB).

   The central bank pays their banks interest for any spare money they
   have got on deposit with it. By lowering interest rates, the central
   bank makes it less attractive to park that money on deposit and
   encourages the banks to do something more profitable with it - like
   lend it to individuals and businesses to spend - thus boosting the
   economy.

   When banks are really reluctant to lend, a bigger stick is required.
   And so in Europe, the ECB has introduced negative rates - which doesn't
   just encourage lending but punishes the banks if they don't. If there
   isn't anyone who wants to borrow that money, the banks end up paying
   the penalty - and that cost could get passed on to customers.

   That is what RBS and NatWest are saying could happen here if the Bank
   of England cuts rates from the current 0.5% to below zero. That's quite
   a lot of caveats and why it is very unlikely to happen anytime soon.

   Bank of England governor Mark Carney has gone on the record saying he
   doesn't believe negative interest rates work, precisely because they
   punish banks, making them weaker and can pass on additional costs to
   customers, which in turn makes the economy weaker.

   The real story in RBS and NatWest's message is the rise in the cost of
   business banking by an average of £8 per month. RBS and NatWest have
   around 1.3 million business customers, as they have traditionally
   offered cheaper business banking than some of their rivals.

   In a world where they can't make any money on those deposits
   themselves, they are having to find income elsewhere. The business of
   banking is pretty simple. You pay interest on deposits at one rate and
   you lend it out at a higher rate. When interest rates are this low, the
   difference between those two rates gets squashed and so do the banks.

   This move by RBS and NatWest is the sound of the banking pips
   squeaking.
