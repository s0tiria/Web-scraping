   Deutsche Bank.

   Deutsche Bank AG might need to raise capital. One thing that makes it
   hard for banks to raise capital is that banks know what is in them and
   no one else does. There is a market for lemons problem. Banks are
   opaque and complicated, and if there is one thing the last few years
   have taught us, it is that there is always some new scandal lurking.
   The banks know what they own and what theyʼre up to, and what scandals
   are lurking, but the investors who might buy their equity donʼt, or at
   least, they donʼt trust that they know everything they need to. And
   banks tend to raise capital when their risks and scandals are most
   off-putting. "Here, have some of this bucket of writhing goop," the
   banks offer, and the investors turn up their noses.

   On the other hand, if you are already immersed in the goop, maybe
   youʼll think that itʼs not that bad? Thatʼs the main logic behind stuff
   like this:

     Deutsche Bank AG, Europe’s biggest investment bank, is exploring
     alternatives to paying bonuses in cash as Chief Executive Officer
     John Cryan seeks to boost capital buffers and shore up investor
     confidence, according to people familiar with the matter.

     Executives at the German lender have informally discussed options
     including giving some bankers shares in the non-core unit instead of
     cash bonuses, said the people, who asked not to be identified
     because the deliberations are private. Another idea under review is
     replacing the cash component with more Deutsche Bank stock, they
     said.

   This trade is essentially a price arbitrage. If you sell Deutsche Bank
   stock to outsiders who donʼt know or trust the bank, they wonʼt pay you
   that much for it. But if you give it to insiders instead of cash for
   their bonuses, those insiders know and trust the bank -- because they
   work there and have had a hand in making the goop -- or at least they
   have to act like they do anyway. So you can get more bang for your buck
   by paying employees in shares than you can by selling shares to the
   public and using the proceeds to pay employees in cash. And this is
   especially true of the goopiest of the goop: Shareholders might
   dramatically discount the price of non-core operations, and raising
   capital by selling non-core equity directly to investors is
   particularly unappealing, but the bankers who understand the weird
   non-core stuff might be thrilled to own it.

   There is a counter-argument that Deutsche Bank employees should value
   the goop less than the market does, because after all they are already
   swimming in it, and they canʼt diversify away their exposure to
   Deutsche Bank the way a regular investor could. These plans could "make
   retaining top staff more of a challenge," says Bloomberg Intelligence
   analyst Arjun Bowry. But this idea has worked great for Credit Suisse
   in the past, where bonuses paid in "toxic securities" that no one else
   wanted gave employees huge returns. Generally, the arbitrage should
   work if the bank is (1) embattled and (2) fundamentally sound, that is,
   if thereʼs a big enough disconnect between how the public values the
   bankʼs weird stuff and how the employees do. Making employees eat the
   bankʼs cooking is fine, if they find it delicious. If they think itʼs
   poison, and have to eat it, they should quit. But if they think that
   then they shouldnʼt really be selling shares to the public either.

   Meanwhile in retail banking.

   In some ways the Wells Fargo & Co. fake accounts scandal was too easy:
   Wells Fargo bankers opened millions of accounts for customers without
   telling the customers, and that is just straightforwardly bad, so Wells
   Fargo is in trouble. But in the aftermath of that trouble, it seems
   increasingly like the big problem at Wells Fargo was not so much the
   fake accounts -- which mostly didnʼt charge fees and which many
   customers didnʼt notice -- but the real accounts that Wells Fargo
   opened for customers who didnʼt understand what they were getting. The
   outrage at Wells quickly moved on from "opening fake accounts" to
   "aggressive sales tactics," with those tactics driven by strict sales
   goals that forced bankers to constantly push products on customers.
   But a whole lot of aggressive sales tactics are distasteful, and even
   harmful, but not illegal. Opening three checking accounts for
   an unsophisticated customer without telling him is illegal. Opening
   three checking accounts for an unsophisticated customer because you
   have convinced him that he needs "separate accounts for such purposes
   as traveling, grocery shopping and saving for an emergency" is pretty
   much just as bad, but legally much grayer.

   Anyway:

     To ensure Wells Fargo & Co.’s scandal over unauthorized customer
     accounts isn’t being repeated at other lenders, regulators are
     poised to start reviewing data and talking to employees inside the
     biggest U.S. banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.

     Wells Fargo’s largest competitors have received regulators’ formal
     requests for information and have been preparing for their practices
     to be scrutinized by examiners in the coming days, said the person,
     who requested anonymity because the process isn’t public.

   But what do you scrutinize? If the test is, do other banks let their
   employees create millions of fake accounts associated with e-mail
   addresses like "noname@wellsfargo.com" (or "noname@chase.com," etc.),
   then it seems like a pretty easy test. If the test is, do banks only
   sell products to customers that the customers understand and that the
   banks think are in the customersʼ best interests, then that would be a
   pretty radical regulatory change.

   Elsewhere in Wells Fargo news: Drinking hand sanitizer is really bad
   for you! And the scandal has been tough on random people named John
   Stumpf and Wells Fargo.

   Is banking fun?

   Ahahaha:

     “I know a client who went on a cruise and told the bank he was
     traveling,” says Andy Pringle at London recruitment firm Circle
     Square. “The problem for senior bankers is that it’s difficult to
     quantify what’s work and what’s not,” he adds. ” Often, your clients
     will be your friends, so if you go shooting with them or have a meal
     with them, is that work or is it pleasure?”

     HSBC seems to be asking just that question. Matthew Westerman, the
     former Goldman Sachs banker who took over as head of HSBC’s global
     banking division in May is reportedly compelling his bankers to use
     a system that tracks exactly how they use their time, exactly how
     many clients they visit, and exactly how many deals they bring in.
     Seemingly gone are the days when you could mooch into the office at
     11am before leaving for a ‘client lunch’ and reappearing at 4pm for
     two hours. HSBC bankers are said to be unhappy as a result.

   Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has eliminated strict numerical sales quotas for
   retail bankers because of, you know. The challenge for banks is that,
   if you want to build deep and meaningful relationships with clients,
   you have to give those relationships some room to breathe. Bankers
   canʼt be selling all the time; sometimes they have to just spend
   time with the clients, building human connections without the pressure
   of an immediate transactional quota. But if the bank is too tolerant,
   the bankers will just hang out with their buddies all the time on the
   bankʼs dime, and never bring in any revenue. One solution is to make
   banking an exciting and lucrative job with highly variable
   compensation, so that smart ambitious people will be bankers and use
   their aggressive best judgment about how to build relationships that
   will bring in lots of revenue. That approach maybe worked better in
   2006 than in 2016. Another solution is, you know, time tracking and
   quotas.

   Blockchain blockchain blockchain.

   Overstock.com, Inc., is doing a rights offering on the blockchain:

     “This is the culmination of over two years of true innovation and
     hard work,” said Overstock CEO Patrick M. Byrne. “Through this
     public issuance of blockchain-based securities the history of
     capital markets is entering a new era, the era of blockchain-based
     securities.”

   Overstock has been blockchain-obsessed for a while, and has a
   trading-technology subsidiary called t0 (a lower-case t and a zero,
   itʼs confusing) that is providing the platform for this. The blockchain
   interest may be related to Overstockʼs famous battle against naked
   short selling: If all of your shares are tracked on an immutable public
   distributed ledger, then you can always be sure that no one is naked
   short any "phantom shares," and you will sleep better at night, if
   naked shorting is the sort of thing that keeps you awake. (It has that
   effect on some people.) For now, the offering seems to be just for fun
   -- itʼs for up to a million voting preferred shares, at a
   to-be-determined price, and is intended "primarily to enable t0 to
   demonstrate the operation of the t0 platform, while providing
   Overstock’s stockholders of record the opportunity to participate" --
   but if it works, you can imagine Overstock one day removing itself
   entirely to the blockchain.

   Here is some correspondence between Overstock and the Securities and
   Exchange Commission, which includes a series of diagrams about how the
   blockchain issuance and trading will work. It is not what you might
   call a pure blockchain trading system, in which every participant helps
   to maintain a decentralized ledger of ownership and transactions, and
   in which trades are confirmed by consensus of everyone on the system.
   Instead, thereʼs a central party -- PRO Securities ATS, the alternative
   trading system where the shares will trade -- that will maintain its
   own proprietary central ledger of transactions. But after each
   transaction, it will take a snapshot of that ledger and do a teeny
   bitcoin transaction, using "the T0.com software to embed the snapshot
   anchor data within that transaction," to essentially save its own
   encrypted ledger to the bitcoin blockchain. (Overstockʼs transfer agent
   will then check that the ledger matches whatʼs on the blockchain.) So
   thereʼll be a public, verifiable, immutable record of each Overstock
   blockchain-stock trade. But the trades themselves will happen in PRO
   Securitiesʼ matching engine and registry, not quite "on the
   blockchain."

   Limits to merger arbitrage.

   If the proposed merger between AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. closes as
   planned, Time Warner shareholders will get cash and AT&T stock worth
   $107.50. Yesterday Time Warner closed at $87.16. Thatʼs ... less. There
   is some reasonably straightforward arithmetic that you can do to
   translate that $20ish price gap into a market-implied probability that
   the deal will close:

     Wall Street is giving the deal just a 28% chance of closing at the
     stated terms as of Tuesday’s market close, according to Macro Risk
     Advisors.

   So if you think thereʼs a 35 percent chance of the deal closing at its
   stated terms, I guess you should buy Time Warner stock. But the people
   who are in that business are capacity constrained:

     The average U.S. deal size hit an all-time high of $476 million last
     year, and there were a record 33 deals over $10 billion, according
     to Dealogic.

     Over the same period, the total assets controlled by hedge funds
     dedicated to merger arbitrage have stayed roughly constant at around
     $23 billion, according to HFR, meaning their firepower hasn’t kept
     pace with the mergers- and-acquisitions boom.

   And "the average $1 billion-plus deal that has been agreed upon but not
   yet closed has been pending 144 days, the most since 2002," so more
   money is stuck in pending mergers.

   One fun puzzle here is: Does that 28 percent implied probability of the
   deal closing mean that "the market" thinks that there is a 28 percent
   probability of the deal closing? Or has the marketʼs mechanism for
   expressing that probability broken down a bit, as merger arbitrageurs
   just donʼt have enough money to express their views about the
   probability of giant mergers closing? If deal activity has grown much
   faster than merger arbitrage funds, and if those funds are locked into
   deals for longer, then the "arbitrage" part of merger arbitrage breaks
   down: If you think thereʼs a 35 percent chance of AT&T/Time Warner
   closing, but you think some other deal is even more mispriced, you
   might focus your firepower there. On the other hand, if there was
   really too little money invested in merger arbitrage, and if arbitrage
   opportunities were going begging, the strategy would be performing
   better ("Merger-arbitrage-focused hedge funds are up 2% this year, half
   the gain for hedge funds overall"), and more money would be coming into
   it. Maybe the reason thereʼs so little arbitrage money is because the
   expected probabilities really are so low.

   Britney.

   A thing that bond salespeople sometimes do is go to a potential buyer
   and say "hey I have a seller of these bonds at 80," and go to a
   potential seller and say "hey I have a buyer of these bonds at 60," and
   convince the buyer to buy at 81 and the seller to sell at 59, and
   collect an embarrassingly gigantic spread. And one of my favorite
   puzzles in finance is: Is that illegal, or what? On the one hand,
   bluffing and misdirecting to try to maximize your profit is an ancient
   and beloved part of trading. On the other hand, directly lying about
   this stuff does seem to meet the technical definition of fraud.
   Prosecutors and regulators frown on this sort of thing these days --
   the leading case, whose result is still uncertain, is the prosecution
   of former Jefferies trader Jesse Litvak -- so itʼs probably not worth
   doing, if you are a bond trader.

   On the other hand, if you are in the business of negotiating product
   placements for Britney Spears videos, maybe give it a go? That is not
   legal advice:

     Britneyʼs lawyer fired off a threatening letter to Adam Kluger,
     claiming he went behind Britneyʼs back and negotiated with Bumble to
     fund her new music video.

     According to the letter, obtained by TMZ, Kluger allegedly told
     Bumble he had authority to rep Britney for an $800,000 deal that
     would put the Bumble name all over her new vid. The lawyer says
     Bumble agreed and gave Kluger $200k up-front. Kluger then made a
     deal with Britneyʼs label, RCA, to pay them $450,000 for the Bumble
     product placement promotion.

     Britneyʼs people say what Kluger did is fraudulent, because he never
     repped Britney. They also say his $350k fee -- more than 43% of the
     deal -- is ridiculous and way above what agents charge.

   I donʼt know, it sounds like he lined up a big trade that both sides
   were happy with, and kept the spread for himself? "He says his company
   is a creative agency that puts people and companies together, which is
   exactly what he did here." Heʼd have been a good bond trader, in an
   earlier, more innocent time.

   Insider trading cartoons.

   Here is a story about a former Securities and Exchange Commission
   lawyer who makes YouTube cartoons about insider trading law. "Someone
   legally prohibited from trading is shown with a padlock over the head,
   while volatile inside information is depicted by an exploding mushroom
   cloud," that sort of thing. They are pretty funny. Elsewhere, U.S.
   Attorney Preet Bharara rang the closing bell at the New York Stock
   Exchange yesterday. As far as I know he didnʼt arrest anyone on his way
   out.

   People are worried about unicorns.

   Itʼs okay, unicorns, you can come out of the Enchanted Forest now, the
   weather is great out here:

     Investors have shown intense interest in new shares that have come
     to market in the past month, especially technology issues. The
     average first-day pop for the eight U.S.-listed tech initial public
     offerings since mid-September is 50%, according to Dealogic.

     That has helped lift the average first-day gain for new tech issues
     in 2016 to 32%, higher than in any other year since 2000.

   Supply is a factor: "As of Tuesday, 20 tech companies had gone public
   in 2016, compared with 36 on average at that point in each of the past
   five years," so the unicorns are still pretty wary about
   wandering outside. But as one venture capitalist says, "It’s
   motivational for companies when they feel like there’s a prize out
   there." You stack enough unicorn treats along the borders of the
   Enchanted Forest, and eventually theyʼll come out.

   Oh and Kobe Bryant is a venture capitalist now:

     Mr. Bryant had a 44.7% field-goal percentage—the number of shots
     taken that went in—during his career. Asked if he’d be comfortable
     with a 5% success rate that is more common among VCs, Mr. Bryant
     didn’t hesitate.

     “I’m going to shoot higher than that,” Mr. Bryant said.

   Super.

   People are worried about bond market liquidity.

   The CFA Institute surveyed its members about what they think about bond
   market liquidity, and I guess it is fair to say that they are worried?
   At least in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where
   they reported decreases in liquidity, decreases in the number of
   dealers making markets, increases in the time to execute orders and
   more unfilled orders. The Asia-Pacific region reported that liquidity
   is fine, so thatʼs a bright spot.
