   [ DISPLAYING ABSTRACT ]

   ONE of the three Whitlock sisters is blind, another is deaf and the
   third has lost an arm, but it is not their infirmities that make them
   weird. It goes far deeper than that, as Alice Brennan learns during the
   few days she spends in their house as an unwelcome guest.
