Full moons, alpacas and nightly fireworks: The weird world of turkey farming

It doesn't take much to spook a gang of turkeys.

   Turkeys roaming the farm

   In Cookham Dean, Berkshire, Copas Turkeys have been rearing Christmas
   dinners since 1957. If you're passing by in the weeks up to November,
   alongside thousands of turkeys and a few alpacas, you might get to see
   a fireworks display. Farm Manager, Steve Hellings, is setting them off
   every day.

   As it gets closer to fireworks night, the daily show will get bigger
   and louder, it will also get later. For turkey farmers like Hellings,
   one of the biggest problems is making sure the frightful birds don't
   get spooked. "We keep going into the night time," Hellings tells
   IBTimes UK, "so that by the time fireworks night arrives, they just
   basically are enjoying the show."

   "We're at the stage where we're still letting them off around dusk so
   this week and next week we'll be ramping it up and they'll be fully
   acclimatised to all the noise and bangs."

   Hellings says that turkeys are essentially herd animals, so if one gets
   spooked and runs, they all follow. "They'll run to the corners in their
   sheds and they'll suffocate each other," he says, and those that don't
   die will be left with scars and scratches.

   So you don't want to spook the turkeys, but here's the thing: A lot of
   stuff spooks turkeys. Take, for example, full moons. Hellings has to
   plan for full moons, "when you've got a full moon, it casts shadows so
   that can upset the birds," he says.

   When driving around at night, the team will sometimes flash lights at
   the birds – not for countryside high-jinks, but because there are
   footpaths through the farm and walkers with torches could scare the
   birds and lead to a frenzy. "We just try and acclimatise them to every
   eventuality that can arise," says Hellings.

   Sometimes he'll let off his shotgun: "I can shoot the shotgun in the
   yard and judge the turkey's reaction and calm them down if need be."

   And how do you calm down a turkey? "We talk to them. Because I'm in the
   sheds three or four times a day and with the turkeys and they know me,
   they know my voice, and you just talk to them, just like you would to a
   dog that's scared of the fireworks, just reassure them."

   Along with preparing for fireworks night, the farm is starting to get
   ready for the Christmas period, where their staff with go from 20 to
   around 200. With all the extra activity that's coming, the turkeys are
   getting a dose of Kiss radio each morning so they get used to the
   background noise: "if you've got people shouting and screaming and
   stuff that can upset the turkeys so we'll play the radio just to get
   them used to the noise really."

   And while all of this is happening, there are alpacas keeping watch. If
   alpacas seem like an odd choice for guard animal, they're not. "They
   get very territorial, so if you put them in a field they will protect
   that territory," says Hellings, "we have two in each field and they
   will sit back to back and they've got really good eyesight."

   He's even seen them chase out a fox: "They were chest out, head up,
   trotting over to it, and it ran out."

   The turkey's have their next test that afternoon. "In about 10 minutes
   we've got a group of schoolchildren coming down," says Hellings, "high
   pitched screams can upset the turkeys so we're about to test the
   theory."

   But with all the preparation, the attempts to make the turkeys fine
   with shocks, you can't really prepare for how they're going to fare.
   Whatever you do, turkey farming is taking each day (and each new turkey
   fear) as it comes: "Something that upset the turkeys one day, they
   won't take any notice of the next day, so it's quite a strange way to
   react."
