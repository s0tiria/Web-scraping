   On social media today: America goes to the polls to pick its next
   leader and many round the world want a say in who it chooses. In the
   Philippines, a Supreme Court decision to enable former President
   Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in the Heroes' Cemetery angers many. And
   here in the UK there's a debate about whether a puppet should wear a
   poppy

   Welcome to the finale!

   opinion

   It's here! The day many are describing as "the series finale of
   America", the day the United States chooses its president, it's
   #Election2016!

   The hashtag #ImVotingBecause was trending this morning with more than
   540,000 tweets and the five most retweeted posts were all from Hillary
   Clinton's former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders.

   His key point? "We need a president who will bring our nation together,
   not someone who will divide us by race or religion," he says.

   Behind him is a raft of Donald Trump supporters, top among them Clint
   Eastwood, who says: "President Trump will save America, Hillary will
   just continue her pay to play scheme but on an even larger scale
   #corrupt."

   Many of these tweets are repeating points that the Trump campaign has
   used to criticise Mrs Clinton - for example over the 2012 attack in
   Benghazi, Libya when Clinton was secretary of state. But many of the
   tweets also repeat unfounded allegations and lies about her: that she
   is an alcoholic, for example, or a murderer or a Satanist.

   Or they exaggerate or distort reality: "We have 1.5 million homeless
   Americans living on the street, meanwhile illegals get free healthcare,
   food, and housing," says one.

   As for the two candidates themselves, Mrs Clinton has been encouraging
   people to vote on her Twitter account, even leaping on to the
   #MannequinChallenge bandwagon with one - a craze where groups of people
   stand as if frozen in action, as a camera pans round:

   While Mr Trump has remained uncharacteristically taciturn, offering
   only a single thought so far:

   months in 170 seconds.

   Messages to America

   listen to your women, stop killing black children, make America great
   again," sings Nadya Tolokonnikova in a provocative video

   It might be America's election but many people from around the world
   want a voice in it as well.

   "Dear America, Please don't screw this up. Love Every non-American on
   Earth," says one popular #Election2016 tweet from South Africa today.

   "Come on, America. Don't let us down. Do the right thing! Please!"
   urges another from the UK.

   Prominent pleas on social media have come from entertainers like
   Bollywood star Salman Khan, Pussy Riot in Russia, Boy George in the
   United Kingdom and Fakir from Morocco.

   And, though comments in response both agree and disagree with their
   endorsements, they all want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House.

   Marcos "no hero" say many on Twitter

   The Filipino Supreme Court decision to allow the body of former
   President Ferdinand Marcos, to be moved to the Heroes' Cemetery in
   Manila has elicited strong reactions on Twitter.

   More than 100,000 tweets mentioning his name have been sent since the
   decision this morning and many of the most popular are aghast.

   "Marcos IS NOT a hero & will never be. His triumphs during his time can
   NEVER justify the death of thousands. We will not forget. #NeverAgain,"
   said one.

   "This is not reconciliation, it is the redemption of the Marcos family.
   Their personal wishes over national interest. Yet again," was another
   comment.

   President Rodrigo Duterte proposed the move in August to fulfil an
   election promise to Marcos's family.

   The decision is opposed by many who say it is inappropriate to give a
   man blamed for thousands of killings, tortures and abductions an
   honourable burial.

   "There are literally thousands more tortured and killed during Marcos
   era. Tell it to their relatives, to their graves, that Marcos is a
   hero," said another.

   Marcos's family still enjoys popular support in the Ilocano region in
   the Philippines but, on Twitter, only a few spoke up:

   "Anti-Marcos advocates expected the SC to rule based on emotion. They
   wanted the judges to disregard the law just to grant their wishes,"
   said one.

   Cookie Monster's poppy

   for British biscuits on The One Show

   And finally - care to join the debate on whether Cookie Monster should
   or should not have been wearing a poppy on The One Show last night?

   Comments on Twitter - and there have been more than 8,000 - fall into
   three camps: baffled; outraged that a puppet is wearing a poppy; and
   baffled that people are outraged a puppet wore a poppy.

   "Hard to get your head around the mentality that thinks there's a need
   to pin a poppy on Cookie Monster," said one popular comment.

   "I'm simultaneously amused, baffled and alarmed by this. What was the
   thought process of whomever thought 'must pin poppy on Cookie
   Monster'?" asked another.

   "BBC called it wrong I think. Papers with headlines like 'COOKIE
   MONSTER DOESN'T WEAR POPPY!' would have exposed how ridiculous it all
   is," said another viewer.

   Some however thought: "Don't know what's more weird, the cookie monster
   wearing a poppy on tv or the outrage that someone put a poppy on the
   cookie monster."
