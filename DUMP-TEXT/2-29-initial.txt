   This week John Davison, Simon Cox and Rachel Weber are joined by Cy
   Wise from virtual reality game developer Owlchemy Labs (Job Simulator,
   Rick & Morty Simulator) to chat about some of the weird stuff designers
   have to think about when making VR games. How do you stop people
   falling over? Why is elbow tracking important? Plus, we ponder the
   really important questions - like what do you call someone thatʼs
   actually in VR? Are they a player? A user? A participant? A VRgonaut?

   Also: We enthuse about Titanfall 2 (again) and needlessly grumble about
   Sonyʼs shoddy PlayStation Pro packaging.
