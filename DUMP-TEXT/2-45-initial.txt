   What do opera singing dogs, the seventh son of a seventh son, a fairy
   tree, a hunt for monsters in the lakes of Connemara, a UFO in
   Mullinahone, a stretcher race and a magician priest who balances his
   niece on a sword all have in common?

   They are all among the oddities captured by RTÉ, Ireland’s national
   broadcaster, throughout its decades of broadcasting. Their along among
   the clips featured in RTÉ Archives Weird and Wonderful collection
   released today (Oct 27) on the official UNESCO World Day for
   Audiovisual Heritage.

   RTÉ Archives, the largest audiovisual archive collection in Ireland,
   has marked the day delving into the vaults to fish out a collection of
   15 videos, which illustrate some eccentricities and nuances of Irish
   life in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

   The archives hold Ireland’s largest audio visual collection, with over
   650,000 thousand hours of moving image and sound recordings together
   with significant collections of photographs, manuscripts and
   administrative documents. The RTÉ Archives maintains and preserves a
   unique record of Irish life in the interest of the Irish public.

   Curator at RTÉ Archives, Liam Wylie, said “We really enjoyed putting
   the Weird and the Wonderful collection together. It is a presentation
   of some of the more offbeat or bizarre stories of Irish life captured
   by RTÉ that will make you smile. We also hope it will make you think
   about the value of preserving audiovisual content for the future.”

   UNESCO declared October 27 as the World Day for Audiovisual Heritage to
   raise awareness of the significance of AV documents and to draw
   attention to the need to safeguard them.  Every year, activities are
   organized by different institutions worldwide around a theme.  The
   theme for 2016 is “It’s Your Story – Don’t Lose It.”

   Commenting on the World Day for Audiovisual Heritage, Bríd Dooley, Head
   of RTÉ Archives and newly elected President of the international audio
   visual professional representative organization FIAT/ IFTA said “The
   archives abound with stories which clearly connects our audiences
   everywhere. UNESCO World Day for Audiovisual Heritage is a great
   opportunity to showcase the importance of keeping these memories intact
   for future generations and to shine a light on the fantastic work of
   the audiovisual archive sector and the continued need for funding to
   preserve these precious collections.”

   The Weird and Wonderful collection is presented on RTÉ Archive’s
   website, where content from the archives is published daily. So far
   this year, over 1,000 stories have been made available with the site
   attracting 1.4 million visits to date in 2016. To keep up with the
   latest stories from the archives follow @RTEArchives on Facebook and
   Twitter.
