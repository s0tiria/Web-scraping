Jarvis Cocker on …

   Bob Lind: The Elusive Bob Lind (Verve Folkways, 1966)

   Click to hear Bob Lind’s The Swan.

   I hesitate to recommend this record because I know that Bob Lind
   himself hates it and that it did a lot of harm to his career – but I
   love it, so here goes … This is the story as I understand it: Lind had
   a massive global hit with Elusive Butterfly in 1965. Someone crawled
   out of the woodwork and sold some acoustic demo recordings he had made
   a few years earlier as a teenager to Verve Records. Verve decided to
   add bass, drums and strings to the songs, which consisted of voice and
   acoustic guitar only, in order to make them sound more like the single
   he had in the charts. The whole affair reeks of the worst side of the
   exploitative music business of those days – and yet … somehow they made
   something beautiful. It’s like a weird, inverted form of sampling:
   instead of cutting and pasting the vocals and guitar over a steady
   rhythm track – as would happen today – Lind’s performances speed up,
   slow down, have irregular bar counts, and the bass and drums just have
   to follow him as best they can. So the songs end up with very
   modern-sounding, unusual structures. The dislocation between the
   various elements emphasises the loneliness in the songs. It has an
   absolutely unique atmosphere – the voice is swathed in a 50s-style
   reverb, the instrumentation and string arrangements are very mid-60s,
   but when they lock into a groove and trance out (like on What Colour
   Are You?) it could have been made last week. It’s not only my favourite
   Bob Lind album; it’s one of my favourite albums, full stop. Go figure.

   Ala.Ni is from London but lives in Paris and she has sung with Damon
   Albarn and Mary J Blige but I love her own music. It reminds me of old
   songs such as Dream a Little Dream of Me. I saw her playing in this
   bar, like some cool 1940s nightclub, and she started singing at really
   low volume, and it was so beautiful I fell in love with her. A few
   years later I was on the Eurostar and I saw her walking past and I was
   like: “Oh my God, it’s the girl from the bar!” So I said hi and told
   her I loved her music. Then I saw her again at a festival and she was
   incredible. The sounds she uses, the mic she uses, it’s really “old”
   and the way she sings is really conversational. She even uses her hands
   in a really elegant way. Listening to her is like having a big hug; you
   feel like you have had a massage.

   You would expect us to be constantly listening to drum’n’bass, the
   Prodigy, Biggie Smalls and bashment but we have a wide spectrum of
   music that we love. We were touring America in 2011 for our No More
   Idols tour and our frontman MC Rage put this on our tourbus and this
   incredible tune called Big Jet Plane came on. The beautiful music and
   combination of male and female voices really touched me. It became the
   soundtrack to the tour and since then I’ve followed their career and
   got all their records. Fans of folky funk with classic songwriting and
   modern production – Bon Iver fans, for example – will love it.

   Click to hear Laura Nyro’s Stoned Soul Picnic.

   She doesn’t have the recognition that she’s due. Other people, such as
   Barbra Streisand and the 5th Dimension, had hits with her songs: she
   was a bit of a Carole King. This was her second album – she was 20 at
   the time. She had so much passion in her songwriting, her voice and her
   arrangements. Very theatrical, in a way: she clearly influenced Kate
   Bush. I love the changes in tempo – these are songs of many parts. Her
   singing style was a mixture of jazz, gospel, soul and pop. But she had
   a real fear of performing live that stemmed from a disastrous
   appearance at the Monterey festival. She retreated from the limelight
   after that, although she carried on making records such as the cover
   versions album Gonna Take a Miracle, with Labelle, which is another
   brilliant album.

   Click to hear Dion’s In and Out of the Shadows.

   Phil Spector produced six of the tracks; I’m a big fan of his Wall of
   Sound. Spector was drinking a lot and quite fucked-up when he was
   making this record. Dion disowned it and he faded into obscurity. He
   described it as “funeral music”. I think it’s a great pop record: grand
   and epic. It’s got that Be My Baby sound, with a lot of the Wrecking
   Crew on. I love Only You Know and In and Out of the Shadows, which were
   both co-written by Spector and Gerry Goffin, who used to write with
   Carole King. It was actually James Skelly of the Coral, who produced
   our album, who put me on to it. Musicians love it, such as Bobby
   Gillespie and Pete Townshend. And Bruce Springsteen, who visited the
   studio during the recording of it. It’s got an uplifting melancholy to
   it, a euphoric heartbreak –an atmosphere I’m always trying to recreate.

   Click to see Simple Minds perfrom The American on The Tube.

   This album charted when it was released, but over time has slipped
   gently into quasi-obscurity. Simple Minds went on to become a stadium
   rock band, leading most people to forget that before super-stardom they
   were idiosyncratic, electronic and Bowie-influenced. I first heard this
   in early 1982 when I was a junior at high school in Darien,
   Connecticut, and for me it was everything that suburban America in 1982
   was not. It was atmospheric, weirdly European and disco-influenced at a
   time when radio in the States was all shiny American pop and pedantic
   rock. It’s a remarkable record that deserves its place in the canon of
   great Bowie-inspired albums.

   Robert Wyatt: Nothing Can Stop Us (Rough Trade, 1982)

   Click to hear Robert Wyatt’s At Last I Am Free.

   This is without doubt one of my favourite albums. Before its release,
   Robert Wyatt was known to me as drummer and co-vocalist of Soft
   Machine, through listening to John Peel, who almost single-handedly
   championed him throughout his solo career. Peel brought Wyatt further
   attention, particularly in 1983 when his original version of Elvis
   Costello and Clive Langer’s Falklands war-inspired song Shipbuilding
   reached No 2 in his Festive 50. By that time, I was already well under
   the influence of Nothing Can Stop Us. It was on my Walkman throughout
   that summer, usually as I hoofed it on a daily basis from Paddington up
   to Shepherd’s Bush, where my mates and I were busy occupying ourselves
   with the recording of a bunch of songs that would be released as New
   Gold Dream. I loved listening to the album in its entirety, and
   repeatedly so. I still do. Why? You could begin by listening to At Last
   I Am Free, followed by Strange Fruit, and then the aforementioned
   Shipbuilding. And perhaps like me you, too, will get a lump in the
   throat listening to what was surely a purposefully pale and wan
   rendition of Red Flag. I don’t think Robert Wyatt knows how great an
   artist he really is.

   The Clark Sisters: Is My Living In Vain (Sound of Gospel, 1980)

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWtrpuPHDcM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed

   Facebook Twitter Pinterest
   Click to hear the Clark Sisters’ Is My Living in Vain?

   This was given to me by a writer I met in New York in about 1982: this
   recording of rapturous devotion to God has abided with me ever since.
   It’s so good … it almost passeth all understanding. Taped live in 1979
   at Detroit’s Bailey Cathedral, Elbernita “Twinkie” Clark with her four
   sisters and their mother, group founder Dr Mattie Moss Clark, perform
   some of the most ineffably sublime music I have ever heard. As funky as
   grandpa’s drawers and with an ecstatic sense of yearning, the sisters’
   goosebump-inducing singing – sometimes fragile, sometimes fearsome – is
   put to the service of eight exquisitely crafted paeans to the Lord. You
   can find a clip of the sisters in their floor-length pastel chiffon
   gowns performing a version of the album’s title song on YouTube, which
   is magnificent but only hints at the record’s treasures. In 1983, the
   Clark Sisters performed at the Grammys, provoking the ire of their
   church, which forbade Mattie Moss from ever performing with her
   daughters again. Her singing of They Were Overcome on this album is one
   of the loveliest things I know. A couple of years after I was first
   given the record, the sisters came to London to sing at [the]
   Westminster Hall. After their astonishing appearance I approached them
   to express my admiration and gratitude. I was invited to visit the
   family next day at a house in Tottenham, or maybe it was Finsbury Park.
   I’m sure I was a nuisance but they were gracious and I was blessed with
   some albums from their back catalogue. Is My Living In Vain is an
   exalted delight and is up there with the venerated best.

   I was recommended these sisters by a female Uber driver in LA; I’d just
   played my song Baby Love to her. It was my best musical ride. She heard
   the gospel vocals in my song and said: “You’ve got to hear these
   girls!” They’re sisters who sing these big gospel songs with so much
   energy and love. It’s inspiring to listen to as it gives me ideas. I
   love the rawness of the recordings from those days. Go find them … you
   won’t regret it.

   I was in the sixth form when I came across this. I was working in
   Watford WH Smith in the music department, and I’d get 25% discount, so
   I ordered it in and used to listen to it on my PlayStation because I
   didn’t have a CD player. I was fascinated because Sawhney was
   British-Asian, too: I didn’t think it was possible to make Asian sounds
   and still be cool. On the surface, the album was about nuclear weapons,
   but really it was about a personal quest to find yourself, with lots of
   songs about love. It’s quite dark, but the lyrics are full of light. He
   was refusing to be bound by any rules. He combined flamenco music with
   Qawwali, jazz with drum’n’bass. It made me ultimately brave. Once I’d
   finished sixth form, I was ready to start my journey as a composer and
   producer. Being boxed-in wasn’t an option because of this album.

   I bought this at the Derrick Harriot record shop in Kingston, Jamaica.
   It was one of the few stores that would carry albums as soon as they
   were released; they used to rent movies on VHS as well, so it was a
   popular spot. When it came out, Buju was already a dancehall superstar
   but it took him to a different level. Most dancehall albums at that
   time were usually a collection of hits that were already out but this
   was made up of new material. When I got home and put it on the stereo,
   it was mind-blowing. Buju was in full-on rasta mode and every single
   song was absolute fire. The consciousness was turned all the way up.
   Even on the party songs and girl tunes he was talking from a higher
   perspective. Champion and Murderer may have been the hardcore boom
   shots that everyone knows but Til I’m Laid to Rest and Not an Easy Road
   spoke to me deeply and truly inspired me even more to pursue music.
   Everyone needs to listen to this dancehall reggae gem and see who Buju
   Banton really is.

   Faine Jade: Introspection: A Faine Jade Recital (Sandiland, 1968)

   IFRAME:

   Facebook Twitter Pinterest
   Click to hear Faine Jade’s Don’t Hassle Me.

   This is one of my favourite psychedelic records – and one of the
   rarest. Get it now! It has the visceral edge of the Velvet Underground
   in places and the wistfulness of Syd Barrett in others. Faine Jade is
   effectively a solo project from Chuck Laskowski, a Long Island-based
   singer and guitarist who previously released one single with the
   Rustics in 1966. Barrett similarities run through the record; one of my
   favourite things about Syd’s songs is the feeling that they could go in
   any direction, at any moment. They are totally tense, raw and
   unpredictable, and the songs on Introspection follow a similar creative
   path. Laskowski claims to have been unaware of Pink Floyd at the time,
   which is totally believable as the tracks never stray into homage
   territory. While seeking to emulate some of the British psych sounds of
   the time, Introspection retains the identity of late-60s
   amphetamine-driven US garage. Don’t Hassle Me captures the spirit of
   rebellious youth, and Ballad of the Bad Guys is a burst of garage rock
   that Between the Buttons-era Rolling Stones fans will be into. The
   tension reaches its height on People Games Play, a song that combines
   the “ostrich guitar” strumming of Lou Reed with familiar late-60s
   percussion and unsettling, monotone vocals. There’s definitely a bit of
   the Byrds in here as well. The lyrics are fairly typical of the Timothy
   Leary era, with mystical lines such as, “Trim the wick with scarlet
   scissors,” but they fit the mood. Laskowski went on to release an album
   with the country rock band Dustbowl Clementine in 1970 but has since
   been largely inactive. More recently, Faine Jade gained wider exposure
   as MGMT covered the folk-rock title track Introspection on their debut
   Oracular Spectacular. Laskowski even gave his seal of approval by
   appearing with them on the closing date of their accompanying US tour.

   Click here to hear Emmanuel by Michel Colombier.

   Herb Alpert produced this album, mostly in LA and Paris. It was a
   hugely expensive project, a mixture of jazz, rock, symphonic, with
   fantastic people on it – Bill Medley, Paul Williams – and some great
   jazz musicians. It’s one of those masterpieces that isn’t what you’d
   call a commercial record, but it’s one of my favourites. I love Herb,
   and Michel, who was a great composing talent. It was a bit of a
   love-in! There’s some amazing music on it: very moving – there’s a song
   on it called Emmanuel, for Michel’s son, who died very young – but it
   also rocks like mad. It was very personal to Michel, who was a very
   unusual musician. He was often in another place, another world. It was
   made for pure pleasure. You could call it a kind of folly.

   Click to hear Karyokinesis by Franco Battiato.

   It’s progressive rock but more short song-based than overblown
   15-minute rock like Yes, Genesis or ELP. He’s a composer and songwriter
   who’s still one of Italy’s best-known musicians; a sort of Italian
   Peter Gabriel. He moved away from this strange experimental record
   towards a more poppy, new wave direction; Foetus is his first solo
   album. It’s a very beautiful-sounding, analogue synth-based record, but
   also very pop: the songs are very immediate, melodic and easy on the
   ear. The Italian version was the first one I really loved; then I came
   across the English version and that suddenly opened it up; now I knew
   what the songs were about. It’s a very original take on describing your
   place in the world; not your usual singer-songwriter confessionals.
   It’s similar to the experimental pop approach of a Brian Wilson mixed
   with someone like Jim O’Rourke from 90s underground Chicago.

   Click to hear Betty Wright’s Clean Up Woman.

   The Numero Group collect really old compilations from obscure labels no
   longer in existence. This album is all of the tracks from a soul label
   based in Miami called Deep City; most of the music is mid-to-late-60s.
   A lot of the players were part of Florida marching bands – the cover of
   the album shows them wearing the most sick, badass uniforms – who later
   went on to run more successful studios that released funk and disco.
   This predates that stuff; it’s tracks that had no commercial success,
   but it does feature artists such as Betty Wright. It’s similar to what
   was going on in Detroit, only a little funkier. It’s a little rough
   around the edges, but if you like old soul, it’s great.

   Click to hear Driving and Talking at the Same Time by he Necessaries.

   This is a record that has even evaded diehard fans of Arthur Russell,
   who played keyboards in the group during their short lifespan and wrote
   two of the album’s best songs: Driving and Talking at the Same Time and
   More Real. When I listen to Event Horizon, I marvel that it isn’t one
   of the most influential records in rock music. But it didn’t make the
   impact it intended to, and was forgotten by Sire and eventually by
   fans. Russell went on to a celebrated solo career after quitting the
   band by jumping out of the van at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel in
   New York, while on the way to a gig in New Jersey. But this is a record
   that needs to be examined further by anybody interested in this era of
   rock music. It’s an elusive missing piece to the lore of the downtown
   scene. Everyone who walks through the door of my apartment is subjected
   to and is changed by it.

   It’s a shining example of an activist-musician using art as a weapon.
   The guy who got it together is Pat Andrade, who organises indigenous
   resistance, helping Aboriginal people, with songs about native rights
   issues and the way corporations own the government. In the punk days,
   people tended to wear politics like a haircut, but Pat actually walks
   what he talks. He was influenced by us [Pop Group/On-U Sound] to a
   certain extent. There are loads of guests – Augustus Pablo, Chuck D,
   Mikey Dread – on this album. He’s a real internationalist; a dub
   activist. It’s resistance through reggae. What he’s talking about is
   really real.

   When people talk about artists who don’t get the recognition they
   deserve, Aereogramme are always the first band I think of. It’s a
   stunning record, so different to anything I’d heard before:
   atmospheric, with beautiful melodies and really heavy riffs. I got into
   Mogwai through my brother when I was 11 or 12 and I thought it would be
   great to have that sort of music with vocals and Aereogramme did just
   that. I love the contrast of light and dark. It was definitely an
   influence on Fightstar. Funnily enough, Iain Cook the guitarist, is now
   in Chvrches, so he did finally get some recognition.

   They were my peers growing up in Edinburgh. I had a massive crush on
   Giles, the singer with the thunderbolt hair: she was like a rock star,
   with incredible charisma and an image that would still look killer
   today. Back then she appeared to come from Mars: she was like a female
   David Bowie to me. I worked in Miss Selfridge and she came into the
   store one day and I kept staring at her. Later I got introduced to her
   at a club and became obsessed with her and her band. I still think they
   deserve more recognition; they were a fantastic pop band. The record
   was produced by Tony Visconti and Martin Rushent, and the result is a
   strange mix of white funk, jangly 80s guitar, catchy pop and synths,
   with girl group harmonies and some “alternative” flavour. They flamed
   brightly for a few minutes then seemed to disappear, but they’re really
   unique.

   Zimmer and she’s just unreal. She did the theme from Gladiator, Now We
   Are Free. That made me want to find out more about her. I really like
   the song Sanvean (I Am Your Shadow). It’s quite dark; heavy and
   emotional. It creates a mood and it’s moving. To me, she’s one of the
   best vocalists of all time. If someone went on The X Factor and sang
   Now We Are Free, it would be unbelievable. It’s whether the audience
   are ready for that.

   This was Carole King’s album before Tapestry, which I don’t think
   anybody bought apart from me and a couple of other people. She made an
   album before it, in 1968, with a group called the City because she
   didn’t really like being a frontperson. But Writer was significant
   because it was the prelude to Tapestry. There are some wonderful songs
   here such as Up on the Roof and Goin’ Back – covers of her own songs.
   But the album only sold about 10 or 20,000 whereas Tapestry sold 10 or
   20m! James Taylor is on it, and [guitarist] Danny Kortchmar; a lot of
   the same people who were on Tapestry. It’s a really lovely album. It
   definitely influenced my writing, particularly the chord sequences on
   Child of Mine. If I’d grown my hair and worn jeans and a denim shirt I
   would have easily fitted into that category of singer-songwriter. But I
   dared to be different and chose an unusual image.

   one-man-band, who classed himself as an entertainer – “The last great
   southern black minstrel show,” as he described himself. He’d move from
   town to town, selling vinyl records and cassettes that he published on
   his own label. It’s folk-blues; the kind of thing that, when you hear
   it, you can’t believe it hasn’t sold a million copies. It’s a guy
   singing his heart out, playing amazing music. The songs are absolutely
   incredible, poignant, dark, really captivating and wild. He wrote them
   about Vietnam, cocaine, the moon landing. My favourite one on this
   album is I’m So Depressed. That’s the one that blew me away. I’m not
   sure if it’s a joke, but it’s really moving.
