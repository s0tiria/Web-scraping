   A three-layer dessert known as the Magic Cake is taking the internet by
   storm.

   It is appealing due to its incredible simplicity ‚Äì it needs one bowl
   and no odd ingredients or weird techniques.

   To make it, you use the basic ingredients used for a normal cake; eggs,
   water, flour, sugar, milk, and butter.

   But by baking the loose batter at a lower temperature, two layers are
   created: a thick, fudge-like base layer, and a custard centre.

   Whipped egg whites are added to the batter last which create a textured
   topping.

   Variations of the cake have been circulating on the internet for years
   now, but from time to time the dessert gets a random resurgence.

   After various peaks over the past five years, the number of Google
   searches for magic cake soared dramatically last month ‚Äì presumably as
   the autumn weather arrived and people wanted warming comfort food.

   It could be down to its visual appeal, because while it looks
   high-effort, it involves very little elbow grease.


   So weekend attempt, the famous "magic cake" , one batter, 3 layers ,
   interesting to see it becomes like that after baking. How the
   separation when it bakes. Taste wise,eggy texture but still creamy and
   definitely something to try again with other flavours. Perhaps coffee?

   Baking bloggers have put their own twist onto the simple recipe,
   tweaking their own with chocolate, pumpkin spice, peanut butter, lemon,
   and gingerbread.

   Others have experimented with butterscotch, eggnog, matcha powder and
   rhubarb for some interesting concoctions.

   A basic recipe sees four eggs separated, and the whites whisked until
   stiff.

   In a separate bowl, the egg yolks are beaten with sugar, water and
   vanilla until light.

   Melted butter is then added , plus flour, milk and the beaten egg
   whites.

   Cooking temperatures and times vary, but a finished magic cake
   typically takes around one hour.

   Before eating, it needs to cool in the pan for at least three hours.
