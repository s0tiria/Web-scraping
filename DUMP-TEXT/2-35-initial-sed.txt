   For the style set, the Melbourne Cup is an opportunity to flex their
   sartorial muscles and show the nation what their fashion nous is made
   of.

   And though thousands of impeccably-dressed, stylish race-goers descend
   on Flemington every year, there are always just as many who turn up as
   if they're still rocking their Halloween costumes.

   And this year's bizarre punters' outfits have not disappointed so far.

   From co-ordinating superhero suits to glammed-up spectators sporting
   fishnet tights and feathered headpieces, and even one woman sporting an
   all-fluffy, all-orange trouser suit, Melbourne Cup 2016 once more
   showed it is as much a celebration of fashion as it is the weird and
   the wonderful.

   Some of the first excited punters through the gates at 8.30am on
   Tuesday were some of the most strangely dressed.

   One woman channelled a Big Bird aesthetic, thanks to her all-fluffy,
   all-orange outfit, while another opted for a witch's hat, purple
   sunglasses and what looked to be stockings on her arms - presumably the
   remnants from her Halloween costume from Monday night.

   Others came dressed according to the time of year, too, such as one
   group who rocked ghoulish attire, face paint and stockings.

   Another group of women sported identikit black wigs, red feather boas,
   fishnet tights and heart-shaped sunglasses.

   One eccentric fashion lover even donned a huge hat featuring elements
   from the Melbourne Cup as details - including horses, jockeys, foliage
   and spectators.

   It wasn't just the women cracking out their finest attire for the most
   prestigious race of the Spring Racing season , either.

   Flemington's men were also dressed to the nines in honour of the
   occasion.

   While a group of four males sported co-ordinating two piece, superhero
   suits, another punter painted his face and paired a singlet-style top
   with a tartan sash and kilt.

   Another group seemed to be dressed as jockeys, complete with yellow
   shirts, bow ties and orange headpieces.

   The 3,200-metre race kicks off at 3pm on Tuesday and is the most
   prestigious race of the Spring Racing season.

   Attended by close to 100,000 people from all over the country, it is
   known as 'the race that stops the nation'.

   The Melbourne Cup is also widely perceived to be one of the richest
   prizes in Australian sport.
