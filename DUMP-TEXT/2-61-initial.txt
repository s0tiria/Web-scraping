   Officials fielded calls about bacon, plugs and old pound notes in the
   last year

   Requests for information about recruiting a butler and shops selling
   English bacon are among the bizarre calls made to British consular
   staff, the Foreign Office has said.

   It has revealed the strangest inquiries of the year to remind the
   public its helpline should be for emergencies.

   A call was also taken from a man planning to move to Spain who was
   worried about encountering nudists.

   But the vast majority were from Britons needing genuine assistance.

   The Foreign Office said almost half a million calls were made in the
   last year to its consular service number, which provides emergency help
   to Britons in trouble overseas.

   It dealt with 3,250 Britons in hospital, 4,770 who were arrested, and
   the families of 3,670 who died overseas. Nearly 38,000 replacement
   travel documents were issued.

   Making up the rest of the top 10 list of bizarre calls, however, were
   inquires from:
     * A holidaymaker attempting to find travel advice about Coventry
     * A woman asking for the contact details of a British person on
       YouTube
     * A European film-maker looking for an English pensioner for a role
     * A woman disappointed the British Embassy had not given her a tour
       of St Petersburg in Russia
     * A British man asking for assistance to get illegal employment in
       Singapore
     * A businessman looking for information on plug sockets
     * A man in South Korea asking what he could do with old pound notes.

   Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister James Duddridge said consular
   staff "do an amazing job helping out Brits in trouble around the world
   but they are there to help with genuine emergencies and not as an
   alternative to directory inquiries".

   Head of the FCO's Global Contact Centres Kelvin Green said: "We receive
   thousands of calls a year, and do all we can to help people who find
   themselves in difficulty abroad.

   "But we cannot help people make travel arrangements or lifestyle plans,
   lend them money or pay medical and other bills for them."
