The five weirdest conspiracy theories about the US Election

   7 November 2016 • 2:53pm

   This has been perhaps the strangest US election in history - and the
   rise of social media and online news has made it easier than ever for
   oddball conspiracy theories to spread.

   Here are some of the crackpot claims circulating about the election.
   US president countdown

1. Some think the whole election is rigged...

   The person spreading this conspiracy theory is none other than Donald
   Trump himself. He may not accept the election if Mrs Clinton wins,
   because it has been "rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with
   the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into
   news!"

   The media has not needed to "put stories that never happened into news"
   - there is plenty of video evidence of the presidential candidate being
   controversial.

     The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and
     distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling
     places - SAD
     — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016

2. ... And that the media is in on it

   People on the far-Left and far-Right both echo the opinion that one
   shouldn't believe the "biased MSM" and should instead trust blogs and
   Wikileaks.

   The "maddest Left-wing website in the world", The Canary, has decided
   to publish an article hinting the election is rigged.

     The Canary joins-in on the Trump "rigged" election conspiracy
     theories, based on one test post of the results

     — Robin Henry (@Robin_Henry) November 7, 2016

   This article focuses on the fact a news site appears to have
   accidentally published their test article for the election results day
   - and it says Hillary Clinton will win.

   The Canary writes: "But what does this most recent leak actually prove?
   We know that mainstream media outlets influence public opinion, and
   that they often have connections to the rich and powerful. But would
   they really go to the extent of rigging election results?

   "On 9 November, we’ll discover who has won the election. And we’ll see
   if the numbers match those leaked by WRCB. Only then will we have the
   answer to the questions above."

3. Rumours that Hillary Clinton is ill or even dead

   Hillary Clinton had to admit to having pneumonia in September,
   cancelling some appearances until she recovered. However, some
   conspiracy theorists thought the situation was far more grave. Sources,
   including website the Inquisitr have claimed the presidential candidate
   could be using a body double.

   And there are plenty of videos on YouTube claiming Mrs Clinton is
   seriously ill and even dying due to tiny pieces of inconsequential
   "evidence" - seemingly hoping to prove she is unfit to be president.

4. Unfounded claims that Mrs Clinton is a satanist

   Wikileaks took time off exposing corruption to spread a rumour that
   Hillary Clinton was linked to a ritual called 'Spirit Cooking', which
   allegedly involves "blood, sperm and breast milk".

     The Podestas' "Spirit Cooking" dinner?
     It's not what you think.
     It's blood, sperm and breastmilk.
     But mostly blood.https://t.co/gGPWFS3B2H pic.twitter.com/I43KiiraDh
     — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016

   This is because in an email allegedly from campaign chairman John
   Podesta's brother Tony, the phrase "spirit cooking" is mentioned. The
   website then linked to a video which shows artist Marina Abramovic
   doing a presentation called Spirit Cooking, which mentions the human
   bodily fluids.

   Obviously, alt-Right blogs latched on to this rumour and decided to
   spread around that Hillary Clinton takes part in a "satanic practice"
   despite not sending or receiving any emails to do with Spirit Cooking.

   The website Snopes has debunked this conspiracy theory - Spirit Cooking
   is not satanic but it is an art project by Ms Abramovic, and the dinner
   she cooked did not include blood, sperm or breast milk.

5. And many claim Trump is a plant working for Clinton

     Do you every get the feeling that Donald Trump is a "plant" by the
     Clinton's? #DEBATE
     — Jimmy Trammell (@jtrammell) October 20, 2016

   Many appear to think The Donald has been told by the Clinton camp to be
   as controversial as possible to deter people from voting Republican and
   hand her the victory.

   But judging by the insults both camps have fired at each other, it
   seems extremely unlikely the two are in cahoots.
