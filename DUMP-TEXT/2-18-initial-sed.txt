   Staff budget hotel chain Travelodge have lifted the lid on some of the
   most bizarre requests from guests from wanting a unicorn to help with
   VAT returns.

   The exasperating queries this year ranged from a younger guest asking
   what time the tooth fairy was visiting and a man wanting bagpipes as a
   wake-up call to philosophy books placed at the end of the bed to “look
   like home”.

   Despite its value-for-money rooms, Travelodge has attracted a string of
   well heeled guests with equally bizarre demands from a helipad for the
   boss and a run down of the stock market figures to an English into
   Spanish translation for a presentation.

   Some of the requests have been downright crazy like a guest in Oxford
   wanting a circular quilt or one in Coventry who asked for a white
   stallion to take him to his wedding ceremony.

   Equally barmy was the earnest man in Bath who was keen to find a
   unicorn to carry an engagement ring to his girlfriend.

   And one businessman in Leeds cheekily asked if a hotel worker could pop
   to the shops and buy his wife a birthday present and wrap it too.

   Visitors also took some popular spots literally with questions like
   “Where can I find the Queen on the Royal Mile?” in Edinburgh and “Where
   are the limes at Lime Street Station?” in Liverpool.

   Travelodge spokeswoman Shakila Ahmed said: “With over 18 million
   customers staying annually across our 523 UK Travelodge hotels, our
   hotel teams receive thousands of unusual requests from business and
   leisure travellers.

   “Where possible, the hotels teams go above and beyond to help customers
   however, there are some requests that they cannot help with.

   “For example finding a unicorn to help one romantic with his wedding
   proposal, ensuring there is a blue sky on the day of an important
   strategy meeting for an executive and moving a Travelodge room to the
   roof of the hotel so that the customer could sleep under the stars.”
