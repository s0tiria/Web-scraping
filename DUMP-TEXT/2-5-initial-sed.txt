World of Weird review – entertaining, if not exactly edifying

   Pretend vampires, rodent-lovers, zentai-practitioners, and a man who
   paints portraits with his genitals. Well, it made for an occasionally
   funny hour of TV

   There’s a large branch of televisual entertainment that relies on
   people doing strange and disconcerting things, either as some kind of
   challenge or ritual humiliation, or as the price you pay for being
   allowed to call yourself a celebrity when you aren’t really. Then there
   are those folks who do odd things off their own bat, because they’re
   odd. You don’t have to give them reasons or offer them money. You just
   have to find them.

   World of Weird (Channel 4) is a series that does just that, and it’s a
   very sturdy formula. The only possible difficulty its producers might
   have faced is a global shortage of weirdness, but once they tracked
   down the man who paints pictures with his penis, I’m sure they felt
   they were away.

   Tim Patch – AKA Pricasso – lives in Queensland in a house he built
   himself. He wears an outsize pink top hat and matching bow tie when he
   works, and not much else. He produces, he reckons, about 1,000 canvases
   a year, mostly on commission, although success in his particular
   discipline comes at a price. “I go through a lot of skin,” he says.

   It has been said that half an hour spent in the company of someone who
   is good at his job is never wasted. As a corollary to that, I would
   suggest that 15 minutes spent watching a guy paint with his dick will
   make you feel a lot better about how you waste your own time, with the
   possible exception of the preceding 15 minutes.

   To say that Pricasso paints with his penis isn’t completely accurate;
   he also paints with his balls and arse. He has a method for doing the
   canvas edges he calls “the credit card swipe” that, I must confess, I’m
   still a little haunted by.

   Pricasso’s paintings are mostly portraits, either of famous people or
   paying sitters. The best thing I can say about them is that they’re not
   bad, considering. Presenter Joel Dommett had a go at producing a still
   life using only his member, which proved, if nothing else, that it’s
   harder than it looks. I thank you.

   World of Weird also turned our jaded attentions to Texan vampire
   Michael Vachmiel, who is part of a subculture dedicated to combining
   gothic fashions with total nonsense. The programme claimed there might
   be as many as 5,000 vampires in the US, although I would suggest the
   true figure is much closer to zero.

   Vachmiel calls himself a “sanguinarian”, which means he drinks blood.
   His source – a “black swan” in pretend-vampire parlance – is a
   29-year-old woman who goes by the name of Blut Katzchen. It’s a
   consensual relationship, although it was unclear what she got out of
   it, and even less clear after she explained. “For me, it’s a spiritual
   thing,” she said. “It’s an exchange of energy. It’s growing your own
   energy ... and one of the ways to regrow energy is by giving it out.” I
   think if that explanation made any more sense it would violate the
   first law of thermodynamics.

   One of the pitfalls of televising weird people is that you could end up
   with people who are just being weird to get on television. Obviously,
   publicity is a big part of the dick-painting business (as seen on TV!),
   but I had the feeling that everyone involved in World of Weird would
   persist with their niche enthusiasms whether or not they attracted
   wider notice.

   That might not be true of Jackie from Texarkana, who keeps a capybara
   as a pet. Even as she extolled the joys of having an 8st rat about the
   house, Jackie seemed to be starting down the long journey toward
   accepting her mistake. Chico the capybara is ungovernable, prone to
   escape attempts and occasionally aggressive. “Chico doesn’t necessarily
   like Jeff,” said Jackie, as Chico cornered Jackie’s husband in the
   kitchen. It was obvious that Jeff didn’t like Chico either. In a few
   years, Chico will weigh more than Jeff, and Jackie will probably have
   a choice to make.

   World of Weird made for an entertaining, if not exactly edifying hour.
   It has a tolerant, live-and-let live attitude toward its subjects, and
   it was occasionally very funny. At the end, Vicky Pattison of Geordie
   Shore undertook an investigation of the Japanese practice of zentai,
   which involves shy people dressing up in skintight, all-body Lycra
   costumes for anonymous erotic encounters. Gamely perched on the edge of
   a bed where a zentai threesome were slithering about like snakes,
   Pattison decided it was time to make her excuses. “I don’t think it’s
   too long before one of these geezers is wearing this lass
   like a hat,” she said.
