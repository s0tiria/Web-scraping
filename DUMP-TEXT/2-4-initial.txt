   Canadian-American singer Rufus Wainwright, Australian theatre
   production The Secret River, Barrie Kosky’s production of Handel’s
   opera Saul and a film by artist Del Kathryn Barton starring Cate
   Blanchett mark the highlights of 2017’s Adelaide festival.

   The March festival is the first under the co-artistic direction of
   Rachel Healy and Neil Armfield, who worked together for almost a decade
   at Sydney’s Belvoir St Theatre.

   The program for the 2017 Adelaide festival, which is run concurrently
   with Adelaide fringe, Adelaide writers’ week and Womadelaide, is a
   celebration of the dark, weird and surreal. Thursday’s announcement
   also featured details of new festival hub the Riverbank Palais, which
   will float on the river Torrens throughout March.

   Andrew Bovell’s adaptation of Kate Grenville’s The Secret River,
   directed by Armfield himself, is set to be one of the festival
   highlights. The stunning first contact story, which won six Helpmann
   awards, will be remounted at the Anstey Hill quarry, a natural outdoor
   amphitheatre. “We’re bringing in a sense of ownership for the Kaurna
   people, given that this is happening on Kaurna land,” Armfield said.

   The festival will also feature the Australian premiere of Red, a new
   short film by two-time Archibald prize-winning painter Del Kathryn
   Barton and starring Cate Blanchett. The film is inspired by the bizarre
   mating ritual of the redback spider, whose males offer themselves up to
   the female as a post-coital meal, and has been described as “a
   surrealist cinematic offering and a savage tale of female power”.

   Adelaide will also be treated to Rufus Wainwright’s “symphonic visual
   concert” Prima Donna, which will be matched with highlights from Rufus
   Does Judy, the artist’s recreation of Judy Garland’s 1961 Carnegie Hall
   concert which has never been performed outside of the iconic venue; UK
   company Complicite’s immersive theatre experience The Encounter, which
   is also part of Sydney festival’s 2017 program; and Schaubühne Berlin’s
   strange, sinister and adrenaline-filled production of Richard III,
   directed by Thomas Ostermeier, which Healy said was suitable “for
   anyone who’s fearful that Shakespeare is usually served up lukewarm”.

   Richard III follows on from the company’s production of Hamlet, which
   played at 2010’s Sydney festival. The lead performance by Lars
   Eidinger, who also played the title role in Hamlet, has been described
   as “mesmerising”.

   Healy and Armfield also pointed to Betroffenheit, a new dance work
   about the experience and aftermath of grief by rising dance star
   Crystal Pite and Canadian theatremaker Jonathon Young, who lost his
   daughter as well as a niece and a nephew in a cabin fire in 2009. Healy
   described the piece, which received a five-star review in the Guardian,
   as “one of the most memorable and affecting pieces of work that I can
   remember seeing”.

   In Lebanese-British artist Tania El Khoury’s sound installation Gardens
   Speak, audiences will literally dig into the soil to hear the stories
   of 10 Syrians who lost their lives in the civil war.

   Italian intersex performer Silvia Calderoni will blur fiction with
   biography and performance art with monologue in MDLSX, an exploration
   of gender fluidity and identity. Armfield, who saw MDLSX in Rome,
   called it an “amazing performance” but one that was “very hard to
   classify – I suppose you’d call it dance theatre”.

   The program is packed with classical music, including a one-night-only
   performance of one of the first operas ever staged, Monteverdi’s
   L’Orfeo, which will be recreated by baroque ensemble Concerto Italiano;
   and the festival’s previously announced centrepiece, Handel’s opera
   Saul directed by Barrie Kosky. Described by the Guardian as “a
   theatrical and musical feast of energetic choruses, surreal
   choreography and gorgeous singing” when it premiered in 2015,
   Christopher Purves will be reprising the title role, joined by a local
   and international cast.

   There will also be a suite of chamber music performances to showcase
   the new concert hall at the picturesque Mount Barker Summit. Curated by
   Anna Goldsworthy, Chamber Landscapes will focus on Schubert and be held
   over six days, with Australian composers including Calvin Bowman,
   Deborah Cheetham and William Barton responding to the landscape.

   Among home-grown productions is the world premiere of theatremakers
   William Yang and Annette Shun Wah’s The Backstories, which will explore
   the Asian-Australian experience with collaboration from prominent South
   Australians including chef Cheong Liew, football official Moya Dodd and
   fashion designer Razak Mohammed.

   There will also be a performance of a new experimental dance work by
   Restless Dance Theatre, held in an Adelaide hotel; and 1967: Music in
   the Key of Yes – a musical celebration of the 1967 referendum, in which
   more than 90% of Australians voted to remove racist clauses from the
   Australian constitution.

   For families, Manual Cinema’s Magic City will use overhead projections,
   shadow puppets and live-feed cameras to create real-time animated
   cinema based on the children’s classic by Edith Nesbit; and Adelaide
   Symphony Orchestra will join Miriam Margolyes for a retelling of Peter
   and the Wolf.
