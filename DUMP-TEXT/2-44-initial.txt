Weird Al Yankovic Moderates Fiery Auto-Tuned Version of the Final
Presidential Debate

Al poses some excellent questions

   With the abundance of sound bites to come out of Wednesday’s
   presidential debate, it seems only fitting that Weird Al Yankovic —
   parody songwriter extraordinaire — would step in to create an
   auto-tuned spoof of the night’s discussion.

   In his new video for “Bad Hombres, Nasty Women,” the 56-year-old singer
   replaces Chris Wallace as the moderator of the final showdown between
   Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, interspersing his own mocking
   commentary with the two candidates’ remarks. Notable lyrics include,
   “Can everyone achieve the American dream or should they sign up for my
   Ponzi scheme?,” and, “To stop a cold war what should we be doing —
   would you go thumb wrestle Vladimir Putin?”

   Watch the full video below.
