The world's weirdest ski slopes, from a power plant in Copenhagen to a Hawaiian
                                    mountain

   As Copenhagen prepares to open a ski slope on the roof of a power plant
   next year, we bring you the most unusual places to find powder

   copenhagen-power-plant-skiing.jpg The new Copenhagen power plant will
   have ski runs on its roof Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG architects)

   Everyone knows there's good snow at big ski areas like Whistler and the
   Swiss Alps. But did you know it'll soon be possible to ski down a power
   plant in Copenhagen, or even in hotspot Hawaii? Here are the slopes
   that will give you bonus social media show-off points.

   On a power plant in Copenhagen, Denmark

   In a move that makes total sense for the country we have to thank for
   ace ideas like Lego, innovative Danish architects Bjarke Ingels Group
   are making the concept of a power plant a lot more fun. A 440-metre
   slope – due to open next year on the slanted roof of what will be the
   world's greenest power plant, designed to turn waste into energy – will
   cater for skiers at four different levels, and includes a 45% 180-metre
   black run. You'll reach the slopes via a lift on the inside of the
   plant, and it should be well worth having a nosey while you're there –
   the plant has been designed to burn 400,000 tons of waste every year,
   converting it into enough clean energy to power 60,000 homes. (big.dk)

   On lava in Mount Etna, Sicily

   Skiing on an active volcano in winter is daring enough, but tackling
   Mount Etna's slopes in summer gives a whole new meaning to the term
   "black run". There isn't much snow in the warmer season, so
   thrillseeking skiers whoosh down charcoal-coloured solidified lava
   that's been left over from past eruptions instead. We should probably
   add that Etna still erupts 1.7 times a year on average.

   On a tropical island, Hawaii

   More traditionally known for beaches, surfing and, er, a love of Spam,
   Hawaii gets top marks for being the most unlikely place to take a pair
   of skis. Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano, gets decent enough snowfall in
   January and February for skiing. There are no resort facilities or
   lifts, so you have to make your way up in a 4x4. But where else can you
   be gunning down the powder towards après-ski sundowners on a tropical
   beach? (hawaiiinfoguide.com)

A Scandi-trend too far? After hygge, now skiing with a baby

   In sub-Saharan Africa, Lesotho

   Yes, you can ski in sub-Saharan Africa – in Lesotho, a land-locked
   country enveloped by South Africa. It's perfect for skiing,
   altitude-wise: the entirety of this mountain kingdom lies above
   1,000km. Its resort Afri-Ski is 3,322km up in the spectacular Maluti
   Mountains, which get snow from June to August. The less skilled can
   even go "bum boarding". How about planning a safari-ski combo trip?
   There aren't many places you can do that. (afriski.net)

   In the middle of the Dubai desert, UAE

   Much more glam than the fake slopes in Milton Keynes, Ski Dubai is home
   to both baby slopes and the world's first indoor black diamond run, all
   part of 22,500 square metres of faux-piste. The temperature is turned
   way down – to -4 degrees celsius – creating the perfect environment for
   drinking your hot chocolate, and there is colony of real penguins here,
   too. And when it's all over you can thaw out again in 40+ degrees
   celsius outside. (skidxb.com)
