The Visiting Privilege by Joy Williams review – weird and wonderful

   These singular stories, spanning 40 years, reveal why the American is
   unparalleled in creating worlds where humour and horror coexist

   In an unexpected burst of enthusiasm in The Trouble With Being Born, EM
   Cioran declares that everything by Emily Brontë “has the capacity to
   overwhelm me. Haworth is my Mecca.”

   I feel the same about the American writer Joy Williams, it’s just that
   this Mecca is not so easy to locate. Now 72, she seems to spend her
   time in Key West, Tucson and points in between. The stories drift all
   over the US, with occasional forays south of the border. In one set in
   Tallahassee, Florida, a young woman called Audrey is telling her friend
   Tommy about Wuthering Heights. “Everything’s in that book,” she says.
   To which Tommy replies: “Tell me the whole book.” That, I guess, is
   what I’m supposed to do here. But how to tell the whole of a 500-page
   collection of stories spanning more than 40 years? Especially when I
   really want to just exclaim, “Oh, Oh, OH!” in a state of steadily
   mounting rapture.

     A thesis will one day be written on all the dogs in Williams’s work

   So let’s start with a variant of that. Overhearing an adopted baby’s
   first attempt as speech as “uh-oh”, the narrator of Lorrie Moore’s A
   Gate at the Stairs concludes that “she already knew both the sound and
   language of things going wrong”. Things go terribly wrong in Williams’s
   world, as wrong as they do in Flannery O’Connor. In Congress, to take a
   mid-period example, Jack, a forensic anthropologist, is asked to
   examine a hand discovered in the stomach of a shark off the Gulf Coast
   of Florida. His conclusions could hardly be more drastic: “The shark
   was most certainly attracted to the rings on this hand. This is a
   teen’s hand. She was small, perhaps even a legal midget, and well
   nourished. She was a loner, adventurous, not well educated and probably
   unemployed. Odds are the rings were stolen. She would certainly have
   done herself a favour by passing up the temptation of those rings.”

   Then Carl, a student of Jack’s and a keen hunter, gives him four cured
   deer feet with the suggestion that he make a lamp out of them. This
   seems a fine idea to Jack who not only makes the lamp but also gets
   into hunting, with bow and arrow. Unfortunately, on one of these
   expeditions, he falls from a tree and one of his own arrows “passes
   through his eye and into his head like a knife thrust into a
   cantaloupe”. Severely disabled, as one might expect, “he tended to
   resemble, if left to his own devices, a large white appliance”.

   Carl devotes himself to the invalid’s care while Jack’s wife, Miriam,
   develops an intimate friendship with the lamp – despite a few
   disagreements. “The lamp had witnessed a smattering of Kierkegaard and
   felt strongly that thought should never be confused with existence.”
   Adapting to this new situation, the four of them – Carl, Miriam, Jack
   and the lamp – take a road trip together. The car breaks down and they
   end up in a small town where there’s a museum of taxidermy – after
   which things get very weird indeed.

   It’s a moot point whether Williams’s stories have gotten weirder or
   less weird (in terms of form, not just content) since sustained
   immersion in them so thoroughly recalibrates notions of what a story
   might be that faithful transcription of the real takes on the quality
   of full-blown dementia – and vice-versa. All the while – and this is
   crucial – Williams displays the observational sensitivity and
   subtleness of less wayward masters of the genre. Even a glimpse can
   yield a full portrait: “She was tall and dishevelled and looked the
   very picture of someone who recently had ceased to be cherished.”

   So after Dwight, the proud owner of a restored but rusty Ford
   Thunderbird, takes the car to a garage with his wife, Lucy, it seems
   quite natural for the mechanic’s prognosis to morph into something way
   beyond an estimate of parts and labour: “Rot like this cannot be
   stayed. This brings us to the question, What is man? with its three
   subdivisions, What can he know? What ought he do? What may he hope?
   Questions which concern us all, even you, little lady.” Reconciled to
   the car’s terminal lack of roadworthiness Dwight installs it in their
   living room.

   ‘Observational sensitivity and subtleness’: Joy Williams in 2015.

   There’s a bunch of other stuff I haven’t mentioned: that Dwight had
   decided Lucy would be his wife when he was 25 and she was a
   four-month-old baby; that one of Dwight’s old girlfriends had recently
   suffered the amputation of a leg – which “was in ashes in a church
   garden, waiting for the rest of her” – and that there’s a vignette of a
   snorkelling trip in a cove so overpopulated with tourists that “the
   fish could scarcely be seen for all the suntan oil floating in the
   water”.

   Oh, and there’s a dog, naturally. A thesis will one day be written on
   all the dogs in Williams’s work. In one of the earliest stories a
   mother and daughter are desperate to take home a dog advertised for
   adoption because, as the mum explains, the kid lost her own dog the
   week before. “Kicked to death by one of the horses. Must have broken
   every bone in his fluffy little body.”

   On the up side, Turner, a dog that has fallen overboard on a ferry
   crossing, is miraculously plucked from the waves and reunited with its
   grateful owners – who then announce that it’s not Turner after all and
   leave the boat to heckles. Witnessing the rejection of this poor
   creature, a witness concludes: “I never saw a dog looked more like
   another dog in my life.”

   So, yes, light turns to dark and dark to light but the distinction is
   hard to sustain. Three quick examples: “Suddenly, there was a deceptive
   light in the darkness. A light that blackly reminded the lonely of the
   darkness.” “The sky had pieces of black running through it, like
   something that had died during the night.” “Daylight was just beginning
   to flourish on the city of Jacksonville. It fell without prejudice on
   the slaughterhouse, Dairy Queens and courthouses, on the car lots,
   Sabal palms and a billboard advertisement for pies.”

   Is there perhaps an echo of the famous description of snow falling at
   the end of Joyce’s story The Dead here? And when Constance descends the
   stairs after a long anticipated visit to the lighthouse – “She did not
   know, exactly, what it was she had expected but it had certainly not
   been 18 black heavy-duty truck batteries” – is there maybe a deadpan
   allusion to Virginia Woolf?

   I can’t be sure but I can say, with confidence, that as a writer of
   dialogue her only peer is Don DeLillo (a fan, naturally). Take this
   little exchange, from the title story, between a visitor to a mental
   hospital and a patient who tells her about a room-mate:

   “‘She attacked this guy. She gouged out one of his eyes with a spoon.’

   ‘She gouged it out?’

   ‘I didn’t think it could be done, but boy, she knew how to do it.’”

   At which point, since we’re hearing echoes and dropping names, we may
   as well go real big and cite G Wilson Knight’s essay King Lear and the
   Comedy of the Grotesque, for while Williams’s imaginative world is
   ravaged with “existential horror”, it is simultaneously redeemed by
   ravishing hilarity. As a character decides at the end of the story
   Fortune: “Things had to be funny.” Or as Mr Muirhead explains to his
   daughter when she asks if they were really selling postcards of the
   grotesquely preserved mummies at a cemetery museum in Mexico: “Yes,
   sweetie pie, they were. In this world there is a postcard of
   everything. That’s the kind of world this is.”
