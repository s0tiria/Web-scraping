   We all love Harry Potter - but to what level of commitment?

   That was a question I was about to put to the test in a manner I wasn't
   entirely sure I'd survive - marathoning each of the eight installments
   of the Harry Potter franchise over the course of one night and one day.
   For the mathematicians in the house, that's a straight 19 hours and 39
   minutes of magical goodness; which turned slowly into 22 hours with
   breaks, because I am human and my eyeballs are the weakest of my
   organs.

   So, to celebrate 2016's host of Harry Potter celebrations: from the
   15th anniversary of the release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher'
   Stone, the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and the
   return of the entire franchise to cinemas - I attempted the improbable
   and overdosed on the Wizarding World in true style. Here follows my
   account of the proceedings.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyHV0BRtdxo

   4.35PM– And so it begins. I'm already humming the theme music.
   Dumbledore (Richard Harris-style) is dropping off little baby Harry at
   Privet Drive, with McGonagall transfiguring out of her cat disguise
   into human form. Which probably would have been some kind of
   mind-blowing special effect at the time, but we're low-key going to get
   dragons in about three films so I'm trying to conserve my awe for now.

   4:52PM - “You're a wizard, Harry.” And with that, a thousand childhoods
   instantly made and ruined; in the knowledge that we'd never hear those
   words, even though they were the only thing we desired in our young,
   feeble lives.

   5.04PM – Harry is choosing a wand. He gets one with a phoenix feather
   inside, which is very cool but makes me think there must be a lot of
   insecurity in the Wizarding World. Think about it, you're constantly
   having things chosen for you – your wand, your house, your patronus
   etc. What if you end up a Hufflepuff with a toad patronus and a wand
   with some kind of stink-root in it? How do you live with yourself then?

   5.11PM – Only Hollywood could make King's Cross station look like some
   exciting, wondrous place and not a hellfire of sweat, rage, day-old
   vomit, and delays.
   harry-potter.jpg

   5.14PM – What is up with Hermione in this first film? Sure, she evens
   out and turns feminist icon by the end of the series; but she's kind of
   abhorrent to everyone here, especially Ron. Which kind of makes me
   think she's one of those psychopath gene people; meaning she'll either
   end up owning a billion dollar company or murdering Ron and stuffing
   him in a car trunk.

   6.02PM – Malfoy just got detention from McGonagall because he snuck out
   of bed to tell on Harry & friends. I love that Hogwarts works on prison
   rules. Snitches get stitches.

   6.58 PM – The Philosopher's Stone has finally been uncovered and
   Professor Quirrell's been turned to ash; meaning Harry's killed in cold
   blood for the first time. Excellent! It's one film down and I'm feeling
   magical in every fibre of my being. What an absolute, sugary sweet
   delight Philosopher's Stone is; the kind that relishes in the airy joy
   of being a true children's classic. But let's move on – I've already
   eaten half the snacks I bought but, hey, I'm feeling good.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bq0qff4iF8

   7.15PM – The kids age super quickly between these first two films. It's
   abrupt, and almost kind of terrifying. Like, who is this old man
   Potter? Where did that tiny, squeaky-voiced boy go? Is this really how
   unforgiving and brutal the ravages of time are? Is there hope for any
   of us?

   7.16PM – But, Dobby! He's here now, so all is good and nothing hurts.
   He's smashing his head into a chest of drawers. Now he's smacking
   himself in the face with a lamp. I relate to Dobby a lot.

   7.31PM – Not only does Chamber of Secrets introduce all-time legend
   Dobby into the game, but it also features maybe my favourite character
   of all – work with me on this – Gilderoy Lockhart. He's spectacular.
   None of the women in this film can handle the luscious curled bangs of
   Kenneth Branagh. It's like looking straight into the sun.

   8.48PM - “They can't cancel Quidditch!” Hermione just got petrified,
   but it's good that Oliver Wood's keeping his priorities straight.
   Dude's got to be unbearable off the Quidditch pitch; like guys who keep
   talking about their gains at the gym, Oliver loves to corner girls at
   parties and tell them about how many bludgers he took down in his last
   match.
   gilderoy-lockhart.jpg

   8.57PM – Right, it's time for the terrifying monster spider to turn up,
   which is the perfect cue for me to leave and make my first cup of
   coffee for the evening; because, when I do eventually sleep, I would
   like that sleep to be largely nightmare-free. If I ever get to that
   point. Also, what is up with Aragog setting all his spider babies after
   Harry and Ron when the only reason they were there in the first place
   was to help Aragog's supposed buddy Hagrid? Burn your friendship
   bracelet, Hagrid.

   9.03PM – Nope. Just walked in again and the forest is entirely a
   blanket of giant spiders and they're crawling over everything. Nope.

   9.08PM – Ginny's been taken by the basilisk – time to step in and save
   the day, Gilderoy Lockhart! Now is the hour of need! Or just go back
   into your office, that is also fine. Or just betray Harry and then
   completely backfire your spell so you knock yourself unconscious and
   lose all your memories, it's all good.

   9.20PM – Oh, come on Tom Riddle; your glorious, floppy bangs don't fool
   me. We all know the true lesson of The Chamber of Secrets and that is
   don't trust people with really great hair. That's why everyone in
   Slytherin looks like they just stepped out of Toni&Guy – ibecause their
   hair was tainted by the devil's curler.

   9.33PM – Harry may have defeated Riddle, but he's now afraid his gift
   for Parseltongue, amongst others things, means he's been tainted by his
   enemy and was in fact always destined to be a Slytherin. Personally, I
   don't know what he's so worried about because his hair is average at
   best.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZdlAg3j8nI

   10.03PM – We're officially entering Potter puberty now. You can tell
   because the Warner Bros. Logo is all dark and moody. Plus, Harry's
   experimenting with his wand under the duvet.

   10.15PM - Alfonso Cuarón directs here so everything gets kind of
   freaky, kind of fast. We're quickly introduced to the (genuinely
   frightening) Dementors. My sincere congratulations to every Hogwarts
   student who didn't take one look at those soul-sucking skeleton ghosts
   and hightail it straight back home.

   10.31PM – Michael Gambon has entered as the new Dumbledore. Followed
   swiftly by Emma Thompson, as the producers of Harry Potter stalk up and
   down the hallways of BAFTA, dragging out every Brit actor they can find
   by the collar. I'm thankful, though, since one of the best things about
   the entire series has always been watching these legendary actors hang
   loose and have the time of their lives on-screen.

   10.47PM – Lupin has always been a fan-favourite for good reason. He's
   maybe the most chill individual in the entire Wizarding World, and
   someone I would just feel really comfortable getting a beer with. You
   can tell he's really chill because he always wears a lot of cardigans.
   harry-potter.jpg

   11.44PM – Gary Oldman is yelling a lot. It's just a master-class of
   yelling, this performance.

   11.55PM – The design of werewolf Lupin in this movie is magnificent.
   Like many fans, Azkaban is my favourite of the series, precisely
   because of this kind of visionary stuff - so good job, Cuarón. Plus, I
   feel sane and awake enough right now to actually appreciate it.

   12.01AM – I am not, however sane or awake enough to really get my head
   around the paradoxical logic of the time-turner; specifically whether
   Buckbeak actually died the first time around we see events or whether
   events had already been altered and he was saved, meaning Harry and
   Hermione's actions with the time-turner were always destined to work?
   J.K. Rowling, help me.

   12.24AM – And so ends the Azkaban adventure, a marker of the major tone
   shift for the series from wide-eyed children's classic into the
   eventual fantasy epic we get by its close.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/3EGojp4Hh6I

   12.37AM – Look, here's David Tennant here to welcome us into the next
   chapter. He's dressed like a Goth ticket scalper.

   12.42AM – Harry is bizarrely dumbfounded by the Weasleys' Tardis-style
   tent at the Quidditch World Cup. He's just spent three movies battling
   giant snakes, spiders, and werewolves; but, my god, this extra floor
   space is EVERYTHING.

   12.59AM – New year, new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Just
   make this an online course already, will you? That said, I do like Mad
   Eye Moody's methods of yelling facts into students' faces, then
   traumatising insects.

   01.13AM – Ah, we reach the great mystery of the Harry Potter movies.
   What on earth is the dashing/successful/popular Cedric Diggory doing in
   Hufflepuff? Did he crap his pants during the sorting hat ceremony or
   something? What happened there?
   goblet-fire.jpg

   01.17AM – Poor Harry's being forced to compete in the Tri-Wizard Cup
   even though he's underage and didn't submit his name to the Goblet.
   It's just like when you walk into a room at a house party looking for
   your phone and next thing you know you've lost a drinking game and
   someone's trying to pour anonymous fluids down your throat.

   02.01AM - “I think I'd rather take the dragon.” Poor Harry time
   continues as he struggles to find a date for the Yuletide Ball. Oh, he
   may be the Chosen One, but he still gets rejected by Cho Chang will
   standing in a tower surrounded by owl crap, because the dude couldn't
   get his act together and ask her earlier.

   03.08AM – So, Voldemort's back and Cedric is dead. RIP Cedric – time to
   move on to your next life as a sparkling vampire babe. Cedric's
   probably the first hardcore death of the series, too. No one's taking
   it well, but I kind of wish I could just gently touch them all on the
   shoulder and be, like, “buddy, it's about to get a whole bunch worse.”

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6ZW7KXaXYk

   03.38AM – I've officially passed the halfway point. My sanity is
   somewhat intact, though words and actions are starting to blur into one
   magical fever. Harry is sitting on a swing and staring into nothingness
   and that sort of sums up how I feel right now. Dudley's transformed
   into some silver chain-wearing thug. We're in deep teenagerdom now.

   04.14AM – Dolores Umbridge's Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson plans
   being theoretically-based rather than practically-based - when all the
   students know it won't prepare them for facing Voldemort - feels like a
   very, very sick burn against the current education system. Nice one,
   J.K. On the other hand, those are some really nice decorative kitten
   plates. I'd definitely take backhanded bribes from Voldemort for a set
   of those bad boys.

   04.35AM – The most essential part of forming Dumbledore's Army is
   getting everyone to queue up and put their names down on a sign-up
   sheet. That's how all great rebellions were formed – remember the
   sign-up sheet they tacked to the front of the Bastille?
   harry-potter.jpg

   05.15AM – This scene where they interrupt Umbridge's exam session with
   a bunch of fireworks is every student's dream, isn't it? I feel like
   Pink Floyd needs to be playing right now. All followed by some sweet,
   centaur-flavoured justice for Umbridge; even though we know all this
   celebration will be short-lived because this is latter-day Potter and
   somebody's about to die.

   05.34AM – And, there we go. RIP Sirius. There's a lot of slow-motion
   crying. Harry's having a moral crisis over whether to revenge murder
   Bellatrix Lestrange; which I'm half onboard for because – how dare she
   – half against because Helena Bonham Carter is a very cool lady.

   05.44AM - “You'll never know love or friendship. And I feel sorry for
   you.” Turns out, Voldemort's just as insecure as the rest of us; which
   is almost a comforting thought. Oh man, remember when our biggest
   problem was living in a cupboard? I miss those days. But we've got
   friendship; sweet, restorative friendship pouring out of our ear-holes.
   And thus ends Order of the Phoenix – with the idea that everything's
   going to be fine, because friendship.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/sg81Lts5kYY

   06.03AM– The Warner Bros. logo is so dark now it's like Batman designed
   it. We're truly through the rabbit hole now and, yes, lack of sleep is
   100% making me more emotionally distraught about this than I should be.
   I'm getting to the point where I can't separate the stakes in my own
   life – running out snacks, drinking so much coffee my heart explodes –
   and the stakes of the film, like Voldemort plunging the Wizard World
   into an age of darkness and everyone getting murdered by Death Eaters.

   06.24AM – Snape is in SO deep right now with Voldemort's crew; it's
   stakes on stakes on stakes on stakes, and I feel like I'm going mad
   with the level of investment I have with what's going on right now. It
   is sort of great, however, that pretty much all you need to do to
   infiltrate the Death Eaters is wear a lot black. Look like you fell out
   of a Hot Topic and I guess everyone just assumes you're evil.

   06.44AM – Hermione's talking about this super powerful love potion
   that's giving off an irresistible smell, but I'm pretty sure she just
   described Lynx aftershave. Am I right? Where's my sponsorship deal?
   harry-potter.jpg

   06.57AM – Let us pause the horror for a brief intermission of teen
   antics. Hey, remember Quidditch? When it was a fun sport to play before
   all the murder started? Or going to the pub to get a Butterbeer with
   your pals? Or describing the respective quality of your crushes' skin
   with your best pal, as Ron and Harry are doing in this painfully
   awkward example of teenage dude chat? WHY IS BEING A TEENAGER SO WEIRD?

   08.08AM – Harry and Malfoy are duking it out in a bathroom. Why does so
   much of the action in Harry Potter happen in bathrooms? That's maybe
   the least magical place you could find in this largely magical castle.
   Anyway, Malfoy is grievously injured because Harry utilised one of the
   spells he found in the Half-Blood Prince's book and everyone's mad
   about it; even though Malfoy and his dad are clearly Death Eaters, and
   why is Malfoy even allowed to attend this school at this point in time?

   08.45AM – Everything just got very quiet. And... DUMBLEDORE IS DEAD.
   Slow motion. Regretful Snape. Tears, endless tears. Bellatrix is
   jazzed. Everything is sepia now. It's just going to be a constant
   stream of death from now onwards; which worries me, because my soul has
   been weakened from sleep deprivation and I'm starting to worry I won't
   make it.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzfEH0UPEBo

   09.19AM – The final stretch. Usually, I'm glad the Deathly Hallows is
   split up into two films because that means more Harry Potter; but right
   now I'm kind of horrified. What if Harry Potter just keeps going and
   going and going and I'll have to watch him raise his kids and pay his
   mortgage? Hermione just obliviated her own dentist parents. Harry's
   waving goodbye to his little cupboard house. Look how far we've come;
   it's like life in that cupboard is now but a sweet, distant memory of
   child abuse.

   09.30AM – Where the hell did Domhnall Gleeson come from? Was this some
   weird sort of father/son duty he had to carry out for Brendan? Did the
   Harry Potter producers only just notice he had red hair and told him,
   sorry, you're playing a Weasley now? And you're married to this French
   chick. Don't ask how or why.

   10.21AM – They've escaped the wedding attack and headed straight to
   Sirius Black's old haunt, Grimmauld Place. No one else is there because
   everyone is dead. There is only a very angry house elf left, who is a
   strong contrast to Dobby because he is neither adorable, nor does he
   smash himself in the face with lamps. Speaking of, Dobby's returned.
   Yay, Dobby! Let's not think about the fact he's only turned up, after
   being absent for half the franchise, so that he can die and make
   everyone cry.
   harry-potter-deathly-hallows.jpg

   10.41AM – I just had to Google whether Martin Freeman was in any of
   these films, because it feels like he should be and I've been waiting
   around 18 hours for him to turn up and it's not happened. Turns out he
   is not in any of these films. This Google session also marks the
   beginning of a long section of this film in which Harry and Hermione
   wander around the woods with various levels of angst.

   11.16AM – The locket Horcrux is trying to murder Harry in an ice lake,
   which begs the question: why do people always wear cursed objects
   around their necks? These kids are having exactly the same problem as
   Frodo Baggins; just because there's a chain, doesn't meant you have to
   wear it. Just put it in your pocket or something.

   11.43AM – Dobby to the rescue! Dobby is so bad ass. I love him and I'm
   not prepared for what's about to happen. Bellatrix is yelling a lot, as
   usual. Who is the better yeller – Sirius or Bellatrix?

   11.47AM – OH GOD, DOBBY. NO, DOBBY Why is this so unnecessarily cruel,
   J.K. Rowling? He was just a little house elf. He had his one moment to
   shine and then you straight up murdered him in cold blood. The distant
   look in his eye – why is this death so emotional? He looks like Gollum
   banged ET banged a bunch of ear wax; yet, still, this is the worst and
   most tragic thing to have happened in the entire Harry Potter universe.

   Who will stop these tears from cascading down my eyes – it burns. Burns
   with the rage of injustice placed upon this sweet, princely house elf
   whose taste of freedom was so short but who gave himself up so
   willingly to sacrifice. Sorry, but that grave they dig him at the top
   of a hill is not enough. Not enough for Dobby, he deserves a viking
   funeral. He deserves fire and tears and sad chanting. YOU WILL BE
   AVENGED DOBBY, I PROMISE YOU THIS!

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/5NYt1qirBWg

   12.08PM– The home stretch. The final frontier. I feel strange and
   emotional – my reality has broken down. I am Potter and I am not
   Potter. This deeply eerie opening isn't helping - with all these
   Dementors flying around Hogwarts and Snape standing there like – ho, ho
   what's my motivation? You'll soon find out. I am still sad about
   Dobby.

   12.19PM – Helena Bonham Carter's performance as Emma Watson playing
   Helena Bonham Carter is fabulous. Although, it's really strange that no
   one in Gringotts is catching on that this isn't actually Bellatrix, but
   Hermione Polyjuiced as Bellatrix - I mean, she's doing zero yelling.
   Not convincing at all.

   12.53PM – There's time to squeeze in one more Brit actor before we wrap
   up, so here's Kelly Macdonald as Helena Ravenclaw's ghost. She is mad
   as balls about her mother's diadem becoming a Horcrux.

   1PM – Ron and Hermione are making out because there's nothing sexier
   than destroying a Horcrux and annihilating a part of somebody's soul.
   Actually, pretty much everyone's declaring love for each other: Ginny
   and Harry, Neville and Luna. The scent of death is truly the world's
   greatest aphrodisiac.

   1.43PM – Here comes the RIP locomotive. Again, what are the spiders
   doing here, fighting for Voldemort? Come on, what's their motivation in
   this franchise? Traitors. Anyway, Lavender Brown's dead and no one will
   probably mourn her.

   1.46PM - And there goes Severus Snape, murdered so Voldemort can take
   possession of the Elder Wand. I'm sad, but not as sad as I should be,
   because Snape's storyline is super complicated and I'm too tired to
   understand what he's up to in dying right now.

   1.51PM – Time for some more RIPs. One of the Weasley twins - I forget
   which, honestly. Over there, Tonks and Lupin; with their hands sort of
   touching but not touching, because this movie wants to mess with us as
   much as possible. Everybody's crying. I'm crying. Someone on the street
   below my window is probably crying.

   2.06PM – Everyone's back as a ghost, though. Which is nice. They're all
   here to support Harry as he destroys himself, the last Horcrux. It's
   kind of like coming to your kid's football game, but you're dead and
   you're here for your kid's death. The afterlife is King's Cross
   station. There are no trains, but there are never any trains at King's
   Cross Station anyway. Harry can just mournfully sit on his luggage and
   eat a cold burrito now, I guess.

   2.19PM – All the Death Eaters are laughing at Neville Longbottom; which
   is awful, but he's also probably used to it by now. Dead Harry isn't
   dead anymore - he's living his own "surprise bitch, bet you thought
   you'd seen the last of me" meme before making a runner for it.
   Voldemort's been turned into wizard confetti. And it's done.

   I feel exhausted, hysterical - but also filled to the brim with magic.
   A feeling of magic so intense that's it's making my toes tingle. Or
   that could just be the sleep deprivation. For 22-straight
   hours, though, I have indulged myself in a dream world that's
   enraptured the globe and I couldn't understand why any better than now.
   I want to wingardium leviosa my life away. Thank you life, thank you
   love, thank you Potter.
