The Strangest Debate of the Weirdest Election Ever

It wasn’t much of a surprise when the candidates skipped the customary
handshake at the beginning.

   Hillary Clinton,Donald Trump

   presidential nominee Donald Trump arrive before the second presidential
   debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016.

   St. Louis— In this weirdest of all possible elections, we’ve now had
   our first quantum debate, for which the only fitting summary is:
   Anything that can happen will happen. One of the strangest things
   happened before the debate even started. Two hours before the broadcast
   began, Trump staged a surprise “debate preparation” event featuring
   three women who have long accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, and
   one woman who was raped and whose rapist, represented by a very young
   Hillary Clinton over 40 years ago, was freed on a technicality. For
   those of us wondering whether, in response to the firestorm of
   criticism provoked by his language on the now infamous Access Hollywood
   recording, Trump would “go there” in the second debate, the answer,
   delivered live on Trump’s Facebook page, was clear: Yes, he would.

   “Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and
   Hillary Clinton threatened me,” said Juanita Broaddrick, who like the
   other women spoke only very briefly at the event, but attended
   tonight’s debate as Trump’s guests.

   So it was not much of a surprise when neither candidate offered the
   customary handshake at the start of proceedings. Nor did it take long
   for the topics of Trump’s tape—and Bill Clinton’s own history as an
   alleged sexual predator—to surface in the debate itself. Though the
   first question from a member of the audience—“Do you feel you are
   modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth?”—gave
   both candidates enough room to avoid the obviously intended topic,
   which they did, Anderson Cooper soon made matters explicit: “You brag
   that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?”

   In response, Trump admitted “locker-room talk,” but denied ever
   actually assaulting women—and neither Clinton nor the moderators
   mentioned the pending lawsuit accusing him of rape. Trump then went on
   to claim that Bill Clinton repeatedly abused women, who were then
   smeared by his wife. To which Hillary Clinton replied by saying that
   Trump was “unfit to be president.”

   Yet that was far from the most bitter exchange of the night. On the
   very next question, when Clinton suggested that Trump needed to
   apologize not just for his crude language on the hot mic tape but also
   for “the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United
   States,” Trump began on familiar ground with his claim that the
   “birther” phenomenon originated with the Clinton campaign—only to
   swerve into a stunning threat regarding Clinton’s e-mails: “If I win, I
   am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to
   look into your situation.” And when Clinton responded, “It’s just
   awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not
   in charge of the law in our country,” Trump interrupted: “Because you’d
   be in jail.”

   Thanks to the town-hall format, though, there were also substantive
   exchanges: on health care, energy policy, and the Supreme Court. In
   each case Trump hewed to current Republican orthodoxy, promising to
   repeal Obamacare, loosen controls on oil companies (and also declaring,
   “Coal will last for a thousand years”), and repeating his pledge “to
   appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.”

   But environmentalists will have been disappointed to hear Clinton
   repeating the fracking industry’s line that “producing a lot of natural
   gas…serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.” And civil libertarians
   should be distressed that, instead of denouncing Trump’s demand that
   American Muslims prove their loyalty by acting as informants—“Muslims
   have to report the problems when they see them”—Clinton effectively
   echoed the suggestion: “We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes
   and ears on our front line.”

   There was even a moment of light relief, on Russia, with Trump first
   claiming, “I know nothing about Russia,” then immediately clarifying:
   “I know, I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner
   workings of Russia.”

   For me the strangest moment came at the end, when, in response to an
   audience question challenging each candidate to “name one positive
   thing” about the other, Clinton praised Trump’s children—and then
   Trump, sounding for all the world like a Clinton campaign ad, called
   her “a fighter” who “doesn’t quit.” At which point the two candidates
   shook hands. Perhaps next time they’ll sing a duet.

       The major problem with the "debates" is the moderator.
       May recommend Jerry Springer!

       It took only about 10 minutes to log in here. Please, editors, can
       we get this log in thing fixed, once and for all?
       It was an old The Nation. columnist, the late Christopher Hitchens.
       who called Bill Clinton a serial rapist, which whether accurate or
       not has nothing to do with Hillary, and perhaps a whole lot to do
       with Trump, whoʼs character reveals to me a like serial rapist. I
       donʼt for a second believe Trump regards women as equal to men. I
       suspect the man suffers serious penis envy, (pardon Dr. Freud) but
       far more likely in men than in women.
       Again, Trump appeals to the worst in men and in a whole lot of
       women too, evidently. And I never thought Iʼd find myself defending
       Hillary. But this is beyond the pale. Trump is a very acute
       neurotic in need of psychological help. Iʼm thinking too of his
       rows with Rosie OʼDonnell, during which Trump was more often than
       not grossly out of line. Indeed, the term, "gross," most clearly
       characterizes him. That along with, "indecent" and "hateful."
       I picture in my mind the world looking in on this contest and
       thinking, "just how silly has the US become, and they think our own
       candidates are but thugs and dictators, etc., etc."
       These are our models of leadership? As I have long suspected, the
       concept, "leadership," is one of those abstractions born of
       ideology. Give me anarchism every time.

       Iʼd like us to stop worrying about Trump getting elected. He is a
       fascist fascist sociopath yes. His election would signal the end of
       America as a free country. But I saw Hillary steal the primary
       election from Bernie in California. If she can do it once. She can
       be trusted to steal it twice: my friends: purged from the roles.
       Their votes: switched to Hillary by the machines. Iʼll be voting
       for the only non criminal. Jill Stein. But Iʼm sure Hillary will
       steal it. So be not afraid that my vote will elect Trump!!

       Hillary did NOT steal CA
       She won more votes by a huge margin
       Vote for Stein?
       She canʼt get over 1% nationwide and she, like Drumpfʼs Gen Mike
       Flynn, went to Moscow to celebrate Putinʼs Russia Today
       Google it; she was online with her praise

   Iʼm having to read op-eds and commentaries about the "debate" because,
   frankly, I couldnʼt bear to watch yet another reminder of what a sorry
   state our countryʼs gone into. I find it hard and frightening that
   these are the only two people we have to choose from as the leader of
   our Government...a foul-mouthed, uncontrollable man-child and a
   compulsive liar are not what I ever dreamed a presidential race would
   denigrate to, yet somehow this has actually happened, with our nationʼs
   citizenry and a lazy media complicit in this "choice". Itʼs beyond
   disgusting, and all over the world people must be either laughing
   uncontrollably or scared to death that one of these two psychotics will
   in fact be the leader or America! This is a blot not only on our
   country but on us as a people that weʼve allowed this to happen.

   Forget the content; most of it was either boring or outlandish. I gave
   both candidates a D+.
   Actually, I canʼt stand it any more. Last nightʼs yclept "debate" was a
   barely above the waterline Hollywood escapade. Who gives a ratʼs *ss
   about stuff that happened 20 years ago? So, if it is relevant, letʼs
   have more of the Orange Cheshire Cat who loves to use a feline term in
   describing what he does to women.
   Oh, thatʼs right. That garbage got out of its cage last Friday. I am
   still fighting the nausea that came over me from THAT detritus.
   We all have to get a grip. This countryʼs in serious trouble, and the
   main reason, in my humble opinion, is that we all have lost our way.
   And that happened because we refused to follow directions that were
   written down for us 2,000 (and more) years ago.
   I fear for our country, because we are substituting foolʼs gold, like
   the Israelites did so many times from Mosesʼ time, for the Creator who
   loves us and wants us to come back to Him. In each personʼs own way. If
   we donʼt, the prospects look dark, indeed.
   just my 2c. I understand this is not a popular theme, but it needs to
   be out there.

   Why was this article so badly edited and proofread? As usual, the
   Nationʼs perspective on the candidates is quirky and idiosyncratic. Do
   you ever see any issue from an ordinary, middle-America view point?

       Right on, Elaine! A large part of the problem is that
       instantaneous, hi-tek, computer "journalism" has dumbed down the
       process of publishing rational, considered, well-thought and
       well-written commentary and observation. Newspeople have always had
       to get a story in on or before deadline, but in the hi-tek computer
       age, there is no time for a journalist to write coherently about
       any issue in a considered manner. Blank, white screens have to be
       filled in the wee hours of Zero Dark Thirty so that weary risers
       can be assaulted by some kind of "news" when they turn on their
       computers. Once again hi-tek has undermined crucial fibers of the
       woven network of society. No one is given time to think, to digest,
       to reflect, to contemplate, and/or to write in a reasoned rational
       manner. This is not just an issue that affects "ordinary,
       middle-America." It affects ALL of America. Hi-tek and BIG MEDIA
       are the ones who are rigging and stealing this election from WE THE
       PEOPLE. The Nation, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The
       New Yorker, and all of their ilk have become the "new dictators" in
       The United States. They are no longer the "good guys" employing the
       likes of Ben Bradlee, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Media moguls
       are now just the string pullers behind the curtains.

       Well-stated. I would not want to be an employee of Big Media.
       Especially now. Where is Morley Safer and his kind., when we need
       him?
