Anna Kendrick was so broke she couldn't buy shoes when she was nominated for an
                                     Oscar

   Being an Oscar nominated actress will make you successful, but it might
   not make you rich

   Anna-Kendrick-resting-bitch-face.jpg Anna Kendrick has publicly
   bemoaned the effect of RBF on her life

   The critical success that precedes an Oscar nomination is not always
   accompanied by financial security.

   Anna Kendrick said that after being nominated for an Oscar for her role
   in Up in the Air in 2009, she was still stone broke.

   “My stylist told me I had to wear the perfect shoes for an outfit, and
   because the movie isn't out yet, nobody really knows who you are,"
   Kendrick, 31, told Ellen DeGeneres. "'The shoe places don't want to
   loan you the shoes so can you buy a pair of Louboutins?'

   “I was like, ‘I’m still poor’. So it was this weird combination of like
   all these great things are happening but at the same time nothing has
   changed so, it was a weird dichotomy.”

   This was nowhere more evident than when she was being placed in
   expensive hotels during promotional tours for the film.

   “At one point I was like, if we do another trip to New York can you put
   me up in a less nice hotel room and then I could keep some of the
   cash?.”

   The answer was a disappointing and categorical 'no'.

   Winning an Oscar isn’t guaranteed to grant instant happiness either, as
   Anne Hathaway recently recalled. Instead, her win prompted a backlash.

   “I kind of lost my mind doing that movie and it hadn’t come back yet,"
   she said. "Then I had to stand up in front of people and feel something
   I don’t feel which is uncomplicated happiness. It’s an obvious thing,
   you win an Oscar and you’re supposed to be happy. I didn’t feel that
   way. I felt wrong that I was standing there in a gown that cost more
   than some people are going to see in their lifetime and winning an
   award for portraying pain that still felt very much a part of our
   collective experience as human beings.”
