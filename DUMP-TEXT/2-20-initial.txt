Why Pokemon Sun And Moon Has More Outrageous Creature Designs Compared To
Previous Pokemon Titles

   We have to admit, Exeggutor Alolan form is quite hilarious. But why the
   weirdly cute designs for Pokemon Sun and Moon? (Photo : The Official
   Pokémon Channel/YouTube)

   One thing about Pokemon games that made them so popular with players of
   all ages are the weirdly cute Pokemon themselves! Imagine Dragonite
   looking like the usual dragons portrayed in fairy tales, it would look
   scarier and not something you'd want to capture, or even encounter in
   the wild. Or would you have thought of Bulbasaur carrying something
   different on its back? The bulb actually made him more different in a
   cute way (mind the countless times we are going to hear "cute" today).
   Then, of course, these are the Pokemon we have grown to love and with
   the upcoming 3DS game, Pokemon Sun and Moon, expect to see a few more
   adorably designed Pokemon.

   Pokemon Sun and Moon's Exeggutor

   Pokemon fans can barely hold their laughs in whenever they see
   Exeggutor. We have to admit, it definitely has one of the silliest
   Pokemon designs with a bunch of eggs in its first form. Then it turns
   into a tree trunk that resembles a coconut tree. However, the Pokemon
   Sun and Moon's version of the Exeggutor is even weirdly hilarious.

   Pokemon Sun and Moon Exeggutor grows over five times taller in the
   Alolan region due to the abundance of sunlight. With its thinner and
   longer neck (and multiple funny-looking heads), it now resembles a palm
   tree.

   Pokemon Sun and Moon director, Shigeru Ohmori, explained to Kotaku on
   the basis of their crazy Pokemon designs, "When the designers first
   came up with the idea, the background is that the sun in Alola is so
   strong, that [Exeggutor] just keeps growing and growing. For the 20th
   anniversary, we wanted to have a lot of special surprises...we wanted a
   funny element. At the same time, we had to find a balance of cool ones,
   serious ones. We looked at the Alola region as a whole and thought
   about that ecosystem."

   How did fans react with Alolan Exeggutor's design?

   According to Kotaku, Pokemon Sun and Moon's Exeggutor Alolan version is
   a big hit and they are either loving the new design or they are simply
   making fun of it. Either way, it's still good media for the upcoming
   RPG game.

   Pokemon Professor Shirtless

   When asked why Kukui, the newest Pokemon professor is shirtless when
   he's a man of science, Pokemon Sun and Moon producer, Junichi Masuda
   (yes, the man behind the Masuda Method), simply answered, "It's the
   temperature." Makes sense.

   Pokemon Sun and Moon is set for a Nov. 18 release. Get your Nintendo
   3DS ready!
