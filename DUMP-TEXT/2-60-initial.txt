   Lazarus, the new musical featuring the songs of David Bowie, has opened
   to mixed reviews in New York.

   Inspired by Bowie's starring role in the 1976 cult film The Man Who
   Fell to Earth, he co-wrote the show with Irish playwright Enda Walsh,
   the award-winning writer of Once.

   Time Out, gave it 3/5, saying it "lacked originality and depth."

   But The Guardian described the production as "unapologetically weird...
   and oddly intriguing".

   living on earth

   Telling the story of a human-looking alien who comes to Earth, the
   production is directed by Belgian Ivo van Hove, whose recent
   productions include the sell-out A View From the Bridge starring Mark
   Strong.

   The cast includes Michael C Hall, who starred in hit TV series Dexter
   and Cristin Milioti, who starred in the stage version of Once.

   Rolling Stone said that although Lazarus bears "all the earmarks of a
   bad idea" being a continuation of another story, with a single-artist
   soundtrack, "the plot is coherent, the songs are great and the
   performances are kinetic". It praised the show as a "surrealistic tour
   de force."

'Pretentious... fascinating'

   The New York Times described it as a "great-sounding, great-looking and
   mind-numbing new musical" and criticised the script, calling it a
   "flat-footed, literal-minded exposition".

   The Chicago Tribune, and The Hollywood Reporter also held mixed
   opinions.

   The Tribune felt all was not "hunky-dory" but said it "feels fixable,"
   adding Lazarus "has the visual sophistication, the pan-sexual
   weirdness, the historicism, the eclectic musical rush of the gorgeous".

   Meanwhile The Hollywood Reporter described it as "an alienation
   alt-musical that channels the trippy dream state of an alcoholic
   extraterrestrial insomniac. So the two intermission-less hours of
   Lazarus are predictably strange, often impenetrable and a tad
   pretentious, but always fascinating, even when distancing".

   James C Nicola, the artistic director of the New York Theatre Workshop,
   said the show had been in secret development for some years.

   Bowie surprised his fans in 2013 when he suddenly released a new single
   on his 66th birthday - followed by a new album - after a 10-year
   hiatus.
