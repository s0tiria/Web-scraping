   A gold bus has been created for Olympic gold medallist Chris Mears in
   tribute to his Rio 2016 success.

   The single deck bus will primarily run along the lime 2 route, which
   serves Mears's village Burghfield Common, near Reading, but will also
   be available for use on other routes in the town.

   It comes after a fake golden postbox was installed in his village in
   August.

   Mears and his diving partner Jack Laugher won the men's synchronised 3m
   springboard event.

   He described seeing himself pictured on a bus as a "surreal
   experience".

   "My old friendship group use this service, so it's going to be weird
   for them getting on the bus and seeing me on the side of it," he said.

   He added that he hopes the younger generation in the town will be
   inspired by his achievements in Rio and for the sport of diving.

   Jake Osman, of Reading Buses, said: "After the great exploits of London
   2012, the gold medal winning athletes were celebrated with gold post
   boxes in their home towns. However, this was only for those Olympics.

   "As Chris will not get a golden post box in Burghfield Common we
   thought we could step up and give Chris something to demonstrate that
   the people of Burghfield, and Reading are proud of his achievements."

   The bus was unveiled at the Pride of Reading Awards on Friday.
