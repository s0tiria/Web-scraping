Mariah Carey calls sabotage after humiliating NYE performance

   A 28-year-old man left paralysed after a car accident has been able to
   feel as though he was touching something with his fingers after a
   robotic arm was connected directly to his brain in a world-first
   breakthrough.

   Nathan Copeland, who was injured after crashing his car on a rainy
   night in Pennsylvania when he was just 18, spoke of experiencing a
   “really weird sensation” as he touches things.

   He said it felt like “my fingers” were being touched or pushed.

   Mr Copeland is able to feel using the robotic arm because it is
   connected to microelectrodes about half the size of a shirt button that
   were surgically implanted in his brain.

   Before the operation, imaging techniques were used to identify the
   exact places that corresponded to feelings in his fingers and palm.

   The discovery that people can regain some sensations using a so-called
   'computer-brain interface' could revolutionise the treatment of
   paralysis.

   Earlier this year the Walk Again Project in Brazil discovered people
   left paralysed by severe spinal cord injuries could recover the ability
   to move their legs after training in an exoskeleton linked to their
   brain.

   That project was designed to enable people to walk by controlling the
   exoskeleton with their minds, but one of the subjects was able to walk
   again using crutches.

Government is completely unprepared for the coming robot takeover

   Professor Robert Gaunt, of Pittsburgh University, who led the team that
   treated Mr Copeland, said they were trying to make use of the brain’s
   natural abilities.

   “The ultimate goal is to create a system which moves and feels just
   like a natural arm would,” he said.

   “We have a long way to go to get there, but this is a great start.”

   His colleague, Professor Andrew Schwatz, said the most important
   finding was that the system could create a “natural sensation"

   But he added: “There is still a lot of research that needs to be
   carried out to better understand the stimulation patterns needed to
   help patients make better movements.”

   When his accident happened, Mr Copeland was in his first year of
   college studying for a degree in nanofabrication.

   He tried to continue his studies, but his health problems forced him to
   put them on hold.

   One of the first things he did after he was injured was to enrol on the
   Pitt School of Medicine’s registry of patients willing to participate
   in clinical trials.

     * 1/20 'Tiny vampires' existed millions of years ago
       Scientists have discovered that microscopic 'vampire' amoebae
       existed hundreds of millions of years ago, and they may have been
       some of the first predators on Earth. By examining ancient fossils
       with an electron microscope, paleobiologist Susannah Porter from UC
       Santa Barbara discovered tiny holes which may have been drilled by
       vampiric microbes. The tiny creatures are believed to be the
       ancestors of modern Vampyrellidae amoebae, and punctured holes in
       their prey before sucking out the contents of their cells

       An Earth-like planet orbiting a star 1,200 light years away could

       about 40 per cent larger than the Earth and may possess surface
       oceans. It is the outermost of five planets circling a star that is
       smaller and cooler than the sun discovered by the American space
       agency Nasa's Kepler space telescope in 2013

     * 3/20 Vegetables grow well in soil from Mars
       Scientists have taken a leaf out of the script of The Martian by
       showing how easy it would be to grow your own veg on the Red
       Planet. In the hit Ridley Scott film, a stranded astronaut played
       by Matt Damon uses his botanical skills to cultivate potatoes. Now
       his success has been emulated by researchers in the Netherlands who
       harvested tomatoes, peas, rye, rocket, radish and cress raised on
       simulated Martian soil supplied by Nasa
     * 4/20 Ancient Roman 'leisure complex' unearthed in Jerusalem
       An ancient Roman estate complete with its own wine press and
       bathhouse has been unearthed in Jerusalem. A series of buildings
       dating back at least 1,600 years were discovered underneath the
       city's famous Schneller Orphanage which operated on the site from
       1860 until the end of the Second World War, when it was turned into
       an army base. The ruins were discovered by archaeologists from the
       Israel Antiquities Authority who were excavating the site ahead of
       building new flats for the city's Orthodox Jewish community
     * 5/20 Scientists discover possible new species of deep-sea octopus
       nicknamed 'Casper'
       Scientists believe they may have found a new species of octopus
       likened in appearance to Casper, the friendly cartoon ghost.
       Researchers with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
       Administration made the discovery by chance as they searched the
       seabed on an unrelated mission collecting geological samples. Teams
       were operating an unmanned submarine on the Pacific Ocean floor at
       depths of more than four kilometres (two-and-a-half miles) in the
       Hawaiian Islands when they spotted the unusual creature
     * 6/20 Black hole captured eating a star then vomiting it back out
       Astronomers have captured a black hole eating a star and then
       sicking a bit of it back up for the first time ever. The scientists
       tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its
       normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being
       eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping
       from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes
       killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen
       before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured
       the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and
       then swallowed star have not been linked together before
     * 7/20 'Male and female brains' aren't real
       Brains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the
       first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific
       parts of the brain do show sex differences, but individual brains
       rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some
       characteristics are more common in women, while some are more
       common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according
       to the study
     * 8/20 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west
       evolutionary divide in North America
       A British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned
       dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years
       ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west
       divide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American
       continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million
       years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow
       sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of
       Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western
       continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia
     * 9/20 Asteroid to skim past Earth on Halloween 2015
       A huge asteroid is set to skim by Earth on Halloween, just three
       weeks after it was first spotted. The rock is travelling through
       space at 78,000 miles per hour, and will fly past the Earth at a
       distance of only 300,000 miles – only slightly further away than
       our moon, and easily close enough for Nasa to class it a
       potentially hazardous object. The asteroid is bigger than a
       skyscraper
     * 10/20 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier
       than previously thought
       Life may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of
       millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using
       graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life
       began "almost instantaneously" after the Earth was formed. The
       researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a
       potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life
       on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system
       was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the
       moon's craters
     * 11/20 Earth could be at risk of meteor impacts
       Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could
       hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned.
       Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively
       safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey
       of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way.
       But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is
       evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing
       through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass
       through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances
       upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge
       of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle,
       scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the
       last 260-million years
     * 12/20 Genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs
       Chinese scientists have created genetically-engineered,
       extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the
       first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the
       amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT
       Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are
       expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for
       hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the
       researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create
       other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have
       human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’
       anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs
       with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further
       understand how they occur
     * 13/20 Nasa confirms Mars water discovery
       Nasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on
       Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae —
       or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new
       findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which
       it has established by finding hydrated salts.
     * 14/20 Bees in the Rocky Mountains are evolving shorter tongues
       With warmer summers, flowers in the Rockies have become shallower
       and more suited to shorter-tongued bees
     * 15/20 The majority of the UK public believe in aliens
       The titular alien character from 2011's 'Paul' - a poll has found
       the majority of the public in Britain, Germany and the US believe
       that intelligent life is out there in the universe
     * 16/20 Researchers discover 'lost world' of arctic dinosaurs
       Scientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk
       kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s
       physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological
       science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How
       did they survive up here?”
     * 17/20 Scientists find exactly what human corpses smell like
       New research has become the first to isolate the particular scent
       of human death, describing the various chemicals that are emitted
       by corpses in an attempt to help find them in the future. The
       researchers hope that the findings are the first step towards
       working on a synthetic smell that could train cadaver dogs to be
       able to more accurately find human bodies, or to eventually
       developing electronic devices that can look for the scent
       themselves.
     * 18/20 The Syrian civil war has caused the first ever withdrawal
       from the 'doomsday bank'
       Researchers in the Middle East have asked for seeds including those
       of wheat, barley and grasses, all of which are chosen because
       especially resistant to dry conditions. It is the first withdrawal
       from the bank, which was built in 2008. Those researchers would
       normally request the seeds from a bank in Aleppo. But that centre
       has been damaged by the war — while some of its functions continue,
       and its cold storage still works, it has been unable to provide the
       seeds that are needed by the rest of the Middle East, as it once
       did.
     * 19/20 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale
       model of the Solar System in a Nevada desert
       Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close
       together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being
       that these images are not to scale.
     * 20/20 Academics claim a full bladder makes for a better liar
       People lie more convincingly if they have a full bladder, according
       to research by academics at California State University. Iris
       Blandón-Gitlin's team asked 22 students to lie to a panel of
       interviewers. Half were given 700ml to drink before the interview
       and the other half, just 50ml. The students with the full bladders
       showed fewer signs that they were lying and their untrue answers
       were longer and more detailed, meaning interviewers were less able
       to detect that they were telling porkies. PM David Cameron has
       previously attested to giving speeches on a full bladder.

   Ten years later, that led him to have the operation to fit the implants
   in his brain and rediscover what it is like to reach out and touch
   things.

   “I can feel just about every finger – it’s a really weird sensation,”
   he said, speaking a month after the operation.

   “Sometimes it feels electrical and sometimes its pressure, but for the
   most part, I can tell most of the fingers with definite precision.

   “It feels like my fingers are getting touched or pushed."

   In a video interview, Mr Copeland, who can move his upper arms, but has
   no sensation or movement in his lower arms and hands, added: "I usually
   feel it in the base of my fingers, in my finger pads, usually a tingle
   or some pressure like someone was squeezing.

   "A couple of electrodes feel like they are on my knuckles ... there are
   a couple of electrodes that feel like a regular touch.

   "It's never been painful. It's just kind of a tingle, it's not really
   pleasant or unpleasant."

   While he can feel pressure through the fingers and gauge how strong it
   is to an extent, he is unable to tell whether something is hot or cold.

   In tests, Mr Copeland was able to tell which of the robotic hand's
   fingers were being touched despite being blindfolded.

   A sense of touch is one of the key things currently missing in robotic
   devices.

   This is particularly important for picking something up – something
   heavy and solid like a brick requires a different approach to the
   delicate pressure control needed when handling a slice of cake, for
   example.

   The research was described in a paper published in the journal Science
   Translational Medicine.
