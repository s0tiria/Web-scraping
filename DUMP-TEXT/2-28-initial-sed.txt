Tragic, funny and weird: Donald Glover's Atlanta is a new high for TV comedy

   With its woozy vignettes and bracing violence, Donald Glover’s sitcom
   shatters all the moulds for the genre, without ever forgetting to be
   funny

The writers of FX's Atlanta: 'We’re not interested in being Sesame Street'

   Read more

   Ha ha! Sob. What place for regular TV lolz in 2016, when nobody can
   afford anything, all our heroes have perished and the world is on fire?
   Good news! The modern US comedy is here to help, offering an escape
   from our misery into someone else’s. Louie planted the seed, Girls
   squatted down and watered it, and now these downbeat half-hours are
   everywhere, following their own rules about how depressing and
   uneventful comedy can be. And here we have another peak for the form
   with the tragic and hilarious, loose and often plain weird Atlanta,
   which finally airs in the UK this week.

   Showrunner and star Donald Glover – AKA Troy the expressive nerd in
   Community – is Earn, a late-20s loser in the Georgia suburbs. Earn is
   smart but his millennial non-job in sales doesn’t cover his rent. Van
   (Zazie Beetz), the mother of his child, only lets him stay with her out
   of sexual convenience and pity. When Earn’s cousin Alfred (Brian Tyree
   Henry) achieves local notoriety rapping under the name Paper Boi, Earn
   spots an opportunity: he’ll be Alfred’s manager. It’s a role that turns
   out to be akin to managing someone else’s farts with a net.

   The United States is thousands of little places, and the best of this
   new generation of micro-coms have a unique sense of location. Glover,
   who’s from the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, shows us dark, still
   streets with none of the dangerous energy of the inner city. This is
   the slower death of the outskirts. On the upside, such areas have space
   for eccentrics and absurdity. You know that feeling when you’re
   cradling your sleeping daughter on a night bus, and the man opposite
   insists you share his sandwich, and you don’t because, although you’ve
   failed at life, you’ve not yet hit the level of being fed by bus
   randoms; but then he vanishes, and perhaps wasn’t there in the first
   place? No? In Atlanta, woozy vignettes like this feel more natural than
   punchlines.

   But blasts of violence underline that young, black America is on a
   precipice. Take Earn at the police station, waiting to be bailed and
   trying not to provoke the screw-ups all around him: edgy farce briefly
   becomes unbearably sharp when a white cop brutalises a mentally ill
   suspect. The moment would feel groundbreaking in a drama; being able to
   swerve into racial politics and back out into comedy – there follows a
   silly scene where two people in the seats either side of Earn have an
   intimate chat as if he isn’t there – it’s even more remarkable.

Is this a golden age for black TV makers or another false dawn?

   Glover has rejected claims made for his shattering of moulds and
   capturing of zeitgeists, and Atlanta does have some traditional sitcom
   bones. Earn is the sane man in the room, forever peering with tired
   incredulity at buffoons, mainly Alfred’s hanger-on mate Darius (Keith
   Stanfield), a classic comedy savant full of stoner wisdom, such as his
   theory that Malcolm X is alive because – hey – since the funeral,
   nobody’s seen his body! (Earn: “That’s how funerals work.”)

   Having fame as his goal gives Earn an endless supply of idiots to
   cry-laugh at. Like a negative image of Entourage where nothing has gone
   right instead of everything, the boys drift on the edge of the music
   scene, bumping into pomposity and corruption whenever they go in.
   Alfred is already jaded at being even slightly famous, annoyed by his
   fans and aware that his tough alter ego is a construct. In this world,
   it’s probably not worth all the bullshit an artist has to cut through
   to remain authentic. With voices like Glover’s speaking clearly,
   though, 21st-century sitcom is managing. Let’s cling to that.

   Atlanta airs Saturday, 10pm, Fox
