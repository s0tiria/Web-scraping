The weird "warm" body part you should apply perfume to - if you want it to last
                                     longer

Perfume isn't cheap, so if you want better bang for your buck, you need to get
creative with where you spray it

   Uh oh. Another day, another thing we're failing at as human beings .
   The good news is, this time, it's just cosmetic.

   Whether you regular splash out on and apply your favourite scent, or if
   you tend to just binge sample every perfume in duty free once in a
   while - all together now - you've been doing it wrong.

   Because when we give ourselves a fragrant spritz , we tend to aim for
   the neck or wrists. Maybe behind the ears if you're feeling fancy.

   Bearing in mind scent is not exactly cheap, there is a way you can get
   better bang for your buck - and make you eau de parfums, toilettes and
   colognes go a little further.

It's just that it sounds a little strange.

   For best results, Steven Claisse, a senior perfumer at fragrance
   company Takasago, suggests dabbing a few drops on the bellybutton.

   Speaking to the Independent , Steven advises the bellybutton because it
   radiates heat, apparently.

   He told the site, "Any area on your body that radiates heat will
   enhance a scent, and your belly button does just that."

   If dousing your naval in Joop doesn't really tickle your fancy,
   however, Steven also recommends spraying your hair, because it holds
   scent well and leaves an enticing "trail of scent" as you go about your
   daily business.

   The downside of this though, is that you risk drying out your hair.

   Other good areas are behind your knees, inside your elbows and on your
   inside calves if you're wearing a dress, because of the friction will
   give of warmth - and an enhanced, longer-lasting scent.

   So if the thought of applying perfume to your bellybutton makes you
   feel a little odd, there are other options.
