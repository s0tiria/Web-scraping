World of Weird: a pale imitation of Tarrant on TV: review

   World of Weird (Channel 4) was like tumbling down a rabbit hole and
   ending up in the early Nineties, a pre-internet world when we relied on
   shows like Eurotrash or Tarrant on TV to bring us faintly titillating
   clips from around the globe. World of Weird isn’t so much an update of
   those formats as a wan imitation.

   This opening episode of the second series comprised four films randomly
   bolted together. Woefully unfunny comedian Joel Dommett travelled to
   Australia’s Gold Coast to visit Pricasso – the world’s only artist to
   paint with his penis. He wore a pink stetson with matching bow tie,
   which was never properly explained. Pricasso recently painted a
   portrait of Donald Trump, which seemed apt.

   Over in Texas, Blue Peter alumnus Ayo Akinwolere investigated America’s
   vampire community, including self-styled “Vampire King” Michael and his
   “black swan” (a sympathetic donor) Blut, who let him suck her blood. We
   also met local rednecks Jackie and Jeff, who kept a pet capybara. It
   turned out, unsurprisingly, that the world’s largest rodent made a
   terrible house pet.

   Finally, Vicky Pattison (the winner of last year’s I’m a Celebrity…)
   headed to Tokyo to become a Zentai, who dress in full-body Lycra and
   exploit their new-found anonymity by writhing around in “love hotels”
   with strangers.

   The irritatingly squeamish presenters – Pattison was the only one who
   was halfway tolerable – squirmed, giggled, gurned to camera and failed
   to ask insightful questions. The voice-over script substituted
   gratuitous swearing for wit. A running time of one hour felt far
   longer.

   This was the kind of derivative schedule-padding you’d expect to find
   on Channel 5 or in some far-flung corner of cable television. Channel 4
   is obliged, by charter, to take risks. Airing tired nonsense like this
   – or, indeed, spending £75 m on Bake Off – isn’t enough.
