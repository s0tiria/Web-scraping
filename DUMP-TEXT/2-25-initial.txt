Send us your stories and recipes for Irish Times Food Month

   Chicken feet stew, anyone?

   Chicken feet stew, anyone?



   Irish Times Food Month kicked off in The Irish Times this week, and we
   are looking for our readers overseas to tell us about the speciality
   dishes where they live. What has surprised, delighted or disgusted you
   about the foods on offer, or local attitudes towards growing, buying
   and eating, or dining out? What weird or wacky dishes have you sampled
   or come to love since moving there?

   Send us an email with your experiences, recipes or foodie pics to
   emigration@irishtimes.com with Food Month in the subject line. Thank
   you.
