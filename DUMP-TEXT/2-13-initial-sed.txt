 A North Korea-themed bar in Catalonia and the pub at the end of the world: The
                weirdest places to order a beer on your travels

   Thought a North Korea-themed café in Tarragona was weird? Have we got
   news for you...

   gettyimages-586876892.jpg Owner Alejandro Cao de Benos at his Pyongyang
   Café in Tarragona Getty

   Just when you thought it strange enough that Tarragona, a pretty port
   city in Catalonia, recently opened its first North Korea-themed café,
   you then realise its owner is a Kim Jong-un supporter and president of
   the Korean Friendship Association.

   When we first heard about Pyongyang Café, which opened this summer, we
   assumed it was a joke theme – a huge North Korean flag hanging behind
   the bar, propaganda posters from Pyongyang plastering the walls, and
   Asian beers in the fridge.

   But then we realised the owner, Alejandro Cao de Benos, is an avid fan
   of North Korea, who claims the country is a victim of a smear campaign
   by the West.

   Not only that, but he apparently hopes to turn Pyongyang Café into a
   “cultural centre” celebrating all things North Korean, with film
   screenings, in-depth talks and traditional dishes all on the menu.

The countries that are worse to visit than North Korea

   Suddenly a trip to Pyongyang Café sounds less fun.

   There are, however, still plenty of other bonkers themed bars around
   the world where you can snap your selfie, enjoy a few stiff drinks and
   yet not be lectured in the wisdom of Kim Jong-un. Here are a few to add
   to your list.

   Tokyo: Golden Gai

   If you’re interested in exploring Tokyo’s nightlife scene, be assured
   that Shinjuku’s Golden Gai area is an absolute highlight. It’s a mini
   maze of six narrow alleys stuffed with teeny bars all piled one on top
   of the other (almost 300 of them), each with their own theme and space
   for just a handful of guests. While many bars have a strict locals-only
   policy, some are foreigner-friendly – you just have to be brave and
   ask. And it’s worth the steady stream of rejection until someone takes
   pity, as each bar is a truly unique character – like Tachibana
   shinryoushitsu, a surgery-themed spot with worrying-sounding cocktails
   such as the “enema” served in surgical beakers, a collection of
   decorative anatomical models and a barwoman dressed as a nurse.

   Limpopo Province: Baobab Tree Bar

   An oldie but a goodie, the Baobab Tree Bar –situated inside a
   6,000-year-old baobab tree in South Africa – first opened in the late
   Eighties. It might be inside a tree, but that doesn’t stop it from
   being kitted out with all the bar essentials, including a dart board
   and a flat screen TV. The tree is large enough to comfortably seat 15
   customers inside its hollow trunk, and is set on a scenic mango farm
   where visitors can also hire quad bikes or go hiking. bigbaobab.co.za

   Berlin: Madame Claude

   The fact Madame Claude bar is a former brothel in Berlin’s too-cool
   district of Kreuzberg isn’t the most interesting thing about it – not
   by far. No, no, the oddest thing about Madame Claude is that it’s an
   “upside down bar”, which means everything you’d expect to be on the
   floor is actually glued to the ceiling. With tables, chairs and rugs
   hanging above you, it’s all a bit confusing – but we have it on good
   authority that this is not necessarily the strangest thing you'll see
   on a night out in Berlin. madameclaude.de

48 Hours In New York

   Manhattan: Genuine Liquorette

   As with any cocktail bar in NYC deemed worthy of the prefix “cool”,
   Genuine Liquorette is hidden within a fast food joint – this time it’s
   Genuine Superette, essentially a burgers and fried chicken spot,
   nattily positioned as “a take on the classic California roadside
   stand”. But more interesting is the basement bar dressed up like a
   neon-lit California liquor store, where cocktails are mixed with the
   help of a “Cha-Chunker” – a hole-punching contraption that upends a
   mini bottle of liquor into a canned soft drink. Sounds daft, but it
   looks great. eatgenuine.com

   Antarctica: Faraday Bar

   Vernadsky Research Base, which sits lonesome on the Antarctic
   Peninsula, has one warming comfort to offer its scientists – a British
   boozer. The pub was constructed from timber meant for a pier when the
   Brits occupied what was then called Faraday station – good to know they
   had their priorities in order. The base was bought by Ukraine for a
   symbolic £1 in 1996, but they kept the pub, with its pool table, dart
   board and bras hanging behind the bar. Order the homemade vodka and
   understand why the Ukrainians here remain cheerful despite their
   isolation. You’ll need to join an expedition to Antarctica to drink
   here. quarkexpeditions.com
