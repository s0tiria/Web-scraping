   The United States goes to the polls today to vote for their next
   president, with Democrat Hillary Clinton enjoying a slight edge over
   her Republican rival, Donald Trump.

   Her campaign has been dogged by its fair share of controversies, most
   notably the prolonged investigation of her use of a private email
   server during her tenure as secretary of state.

   But while every career politician has skeletons in the closet, Clinton
   has also been the subject of dozens of extreme and bizarre conspiracy
   theories.

   Here are some of the most outlandish.

 Clinton has her opponents killed

   Rumours that Vince Foster, a senior White House staffer and boyhood
   friend of Bill Clinton who committed suicide in 1993, was actually a
   victim of the power-hungry Clintons have been a staple of right-wing
   talk radio for decades, despite five official investigations confirming
   he killed himself.

   Similar accusations followed the death of Seth Rich, a Democratic
   National Committee (DNC) employee shot dead in a suspected attempted
   robbery in July. Blogs from both extremes of the political spectrum
   speculate he "may have been silenced for threatening to expose some
   kind of massive voter fraud", Inquistr reports. Others suggest Rich
   was cooperating with hackers leaking DNC emails. The Metropolitan
   Police Department said there was "no indication that Seth Rich's death
   is connected to his employment at the DNC".

 Clinton has a body double

   Conservative media had a field day when Clinton collapsed at the 9/11
   memorial in New York while suffering from pneumonia, diagnosing her
   with everything from Parkinson's disease to multiple sclerosis.

   The Democratic nominee re-emerged on the campaign trail a few days
   later in seemingly rude health. Could it be that she was, as she said,
   actually in fine fettle? Nope, they said, she must have a body double.

     Holy Crap, Hillary Clinton Could Be Using A BODY DOUBLE To Look
     'Healthy' https://t.co/ndisIhfbU6 via @yesimright1

   Professional Clinton impersonator Theresa Barnwell was bombarded with
   tweets suggesting she was standing in for the politician during an
   appearance in New York. After first joking that "maybe" she was in the
   city that day, Barnwell then issued an unequivocal response.

     OK people, calm down. I was in LA today, all day. Was just messin'
     with your crazy conspiracy minded little heads. Go to bed.

Clinton faked a blood clot

   In December 2012, Clinton was hospitalised with a blood clot not long
   before she was due to testify at a congressional hearing into the
   attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, Libya. Glenn Beck of Fox News was
   sceptical, however, asking whether it "just a scam so that we didn't
   talk about [Benghazi]".

   He also added: "If she really had some weird thing in the hospital,
   then it should prohibit her from ever becoming president," reports
   Mother Jones.

   In one of the most bizarre twists of a bizarre election season, Beck,
   who has built his TV career on whipping up conservative hysteria, has
   now said he will vote for Clinton, calling her the "moral choice"
   compared to Trump.

 Clinton's campaign manager kidnapped Madeleine McCann

   The theory that John Podesta, Clinton's campaign manager, and his
   brother Mike were responsible for the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann in
   2007 gathered steam on message board 4chan yesterday, with the two men
   compared to computer-generated renderings of two suspects released by
   Portuguese police three years ago.

   While Clinton's campaign team is highly unlikely to even acknowledge
   the outlandish claim, it has been debunked by at least one unlikely
   source – right-wing news blog Regated, which says the similarity to the
   brothers is "shocking", but "the police sketches are actually just one
   person".

   Pitzer College professor Brian Keeley, a conspiracy theory expert, told
   the Daily Beast such outlandish theories offer "a deep sense of hope"
   for their believers as they provide a coping mechanism for those who
   are "baffled that we've ended up with Clinton and Trump as the
   Democratic and Republican candidates for president".
