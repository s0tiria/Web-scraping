   When a student in her class made fun of her older brother, who has
   autism, one 6-year-old couldn't stand idly by. Instead, she wrote a
   letter to the school, requesting that students learn about invisible
   disabilities.

   Lex Camilleri took that letter to the school's student council and
   later read it aloud to her class before having a discussion about
   autism and what it means.

   Lex's mother, Sophie, was informed of the letter by a teacher who
   approached her after school. That's when she posted it to Facebook and
   the handwritten letter quickly went viral.

   In the note, Camilleri wrote: "On Monday I felt very sad because a girl
   in my class said that my brother was weird. My brother has autism and
   is not weird. I would like it if we could learn about all disabilities
   in schools so that everybody understands that some people are
   different, but we should all be treated the same."

   British mother of three Sophie Camilleri, 44, said she's "so proud" of
   the way her daughter handled the situation.

   "Frank is older than her and that's all she's ever known," the mother
   added. "She's only known autism so she doesn't see it as different.
   She's lived and breathed in from the beginning. That's just how it is."

   who has autism, after a student at her school called him weird.

   Camilleri recalled that a teacher described what happened after Lex
   read her letter aloud. The teacher asked the students if anyone knew
   what autism was and "not one child knew what it was. This is why she
   wants it out there and taught more in schools."

   The family hopes to take their request all the way up to their member
   of Parliament to see if it can be taught in schools country wide.

   "We need to educate children, as young as nursery, to discuss
   disabilities that aren't so visible like autism, dyslexia and people
   that may have a hearing impediment just so that children are aware and
   so children can understand it," Sophie Camilleri added.

   Lisa Goring, the chief programming and marketing officer at autism
   advocacy organization Autism Speaks, told ABC News in a statement that
   increased understanding of autism is needed in U.S. schools.

   "With an estimated 1 in 68 [U.S.] children diagnosed with autism, the
   need for acceptance and understanding for people with autism is vital,"
   the statement read. "Many schools do provide information about autism,
   but we know that this is not done in all schools. To further the
   acceptance and understanding, Autism Speaks provides a School Community
   Tool Kit to help those in the school community support students with
   autism. We also have a tool kit specifically for elementary school
   children to learn more about autism."
