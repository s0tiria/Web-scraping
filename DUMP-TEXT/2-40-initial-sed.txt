   Some of these cakes might not look like they were meant to be eaten,
   but these weird and wonderful designs are award-winning.

   Emma Phillips and Jay Humphris, both from Ebbw Vale , were presented
   with three gold awards between them for their sweet creations at the
   Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show, held at the NEC in
   Birmingham on Saturday.

      'Grotesque' goblin-like creature sat on a tortoise in a muddy bog

   Emma won one of the gold awards for her design called Tully the
   Bogglett, and featured a “grotesque” goblin-like creature sat on a
   tortoise in a muddy bog.

   Emma said: “He’s just a figment of my imagination this time around,
   rather than being inspired by Alice in Wonderland or the books of Terry
   Pratchett as my last two competition pieces were.

   “I even ended up writing a short biography of him, as he seemed such an
   interesting character as I was sculpting him.”

   She added: “As physically unpleasant as he is, with horrible teeth and
   a runny nose and spotty bum, there’s a warmth and friendliness in his
   eyes which is very endearing.

                         'Bogglett kept me company'

   “He kept me company during the many late nights while I was working on
   him.”

   Jay won the other two awards for her Krampus-themed Christmas cake and
   a head sculpture based on the work of artists Tomasz Strzalkowski and
   H.R. Geiger.

   'Krampus'

   Jay’s six-year-old son Toby also achieved a certificate of merit for
   his Minecraft-inspired cake design.

   It’s not the first taste of success for baker Emma, who has previously
   won silver awards at the last two competitions, and Jay, her former
   sugarcraft pupil, has gained a silver and a gold.

     'A crowning achievement and testament to their enormous hard work'

   The pair said this year’s haul of prizes is “a crowning achievement and
   testament to their enormous hard work and talent in this specialised
   field”.

   Emma runs her cake design business from home in Ebbw Vale, as well as
   teaching sugarcraft through a number of classes run with Anuerin
   Leisure Trust in Ebbw Vale and Brynmawr . Jay is a bar manager in Ebbw
   Vale and used to attend Emma’s classes.

   The head sculpture

   Emma said: “The standard of competition is incredibly high every year,
   but this year it seems to have increased massively. Jay and I are
   thrilled and delighted to not only have gained recognition for our work
   yet again, but to have achieved Gold with each of our competition
   pieces.

   "I’m so pleased for my students to have gained recognition for their
   skills too. It hasn’t quite sunk in yet.”

   Some of Emma’s current students also entered the competition this year,
   with bronze prizes being awarded to Denise Bryant and Victoria Bryant,
   and a certificate of merit going to Meg Musa for her work.
