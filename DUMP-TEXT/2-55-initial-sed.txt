   try out being a dentist.

   Visitors can really get their teeth into a "doors open" trip around
   Dundee Dental Hospital.

   Tours of the building will take in rarely seen artwork by James
   McIntosh Patrick, as well as stunning stained-glass windows by Douglas
   Strachan. The event is part of the Dental Hospital and School's
   Centenary Celebrations.
      When: September 17, tours hourly from 12:00 - 16:00. (Non-bookable.

   Aisle was once the highest monastery in Britain

   Soutra Aisle, dating back to 1686, is a family burial vault which was
   built when the Scottish church banned monuments inside churches.

   Visitors can explore the macabre unlocked crypt and marvel at what was
   once the largest hospital in medieval Scotland. The site sits at an
   altitude over 360 metres and was the highest monastery in the British
   Isles.

   activity has been recorded at the Cote in 2016.

   The traditional-looking Owl Cote tower was built in 2008/10 as a nest
   site for wild barn owls. It looks like it has been a success this year
   as research from 2016 shows there has been barn owl activity. The
   question is, will you spot one of these feathery residents when you
   enter the Ayrshire brick and bottle built round-house?
