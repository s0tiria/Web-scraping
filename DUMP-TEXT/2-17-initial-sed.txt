   A hunt for the oddest thing said by a sleep talker unearthed the gem:
   “If they come here asking about the pickles, say nothing.”

   Bed partners also told of their other half blurting out: “Meet me round
   the corner and bring the mustard,” and “I’m a rocket man take me to the
   moon .”

   They were the top three bed firm Time4Sleep picked from examples sent
   in.

   Julie Kenny, of Liverpool, whose hubby Garry gibbered about the
   pickles, said he also snored – “so I’m lucky to get any sleep”.

   She added: “I always tell him next morning what he has said and he
   claims it’s me dreaming. I once taped him to prove it.”
