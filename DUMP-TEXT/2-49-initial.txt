      The financial reason some gang members cover their bodies in tattoos

   Gangs like the Mara Salvatrucha have spread their influence all over
   the Western Hemisphere, and one of the clearest signs that you're
   dealing with their members is the garish tattoos that often adorn their
   bodies.

   The designs of those tattoos can often vary, specified by individuals
   and their gangs, but there's an underlying reason that people get them,
   and it makes perfect business sense.

   "There's a weird economic reason for these tattoos: It makes these
   employees much easier for the cartel or the gang to keep hold of," Tom
   Wainwright, author of "Narconomics" and former Economist reporter in
   Mexico City, told Business Insider.

   "If you picture one of these gangs in El Salvador, where many of the
   members have tattoos, literally from head to toe, it's much much harder
   for those employees to go and find a job somewhere else," Wainwright
   added.

   The Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13, is most closely associated
   with the head-to-toe tattoos.

   Prisons in El Salvador and Honduras, where MS-13 is based, are full of
   current and former gang members coated with ink identifying their
   loyalties, whether to MS-13 or another Central American gang like
   Barrio 18, which is regarded as one of MS-13's main rivals.

   While the inkings are often inscrutable to outsiders, members of the
   gang world are familiar with their meanings. This helps them identify
   compatriots and prevents members from straying.

   "These guys can't find work anywhere else," because the markings make
   it difficult for them to switch allegiances, Wainwright told Business
   Insider.

   "They can't find work with a rival cartel, and so they have to stay
   working for the gang that they started off with. This makes them much
   cheaper and it means that the gang can treat them how they like."

   As these gangs have spread to places were anti-gang law-enforcement
   efforts are more robust — like the suburbs of Washington, D.C. — the
   tattoos have become a less central part of gang life.

   Tattoo-removal programs have also cropped up, as government and
   civil-society efforts to pull people away from gangs have ramped up.

   But for MS-13 and other gangs, where proof of loyalty is vital, tattoos
   aren't going anywhere.

   "It's something that's strongly encouraged," Wainwright said. "And I
   think if you want to join a gang like the Mara Salvatrucha in El
   Salvador, you can't join unless you get the tattoos."
